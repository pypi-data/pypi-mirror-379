MESMER: spatially resolved Earth System Model emulations
--------------------------------------------------------
**MESMER** is a **M**\ odular **E**\ arth **S**\ ystem **M**\ odel **E**\ mulator with
spatially **R**\ esolved output, which stochastically creates Earth System
Model-specific spatio-temporally correlated climate variable field realizations at a
negligible computational cost.

In combination with a global mean temperature emulator, MESMER can account for all three
major sources of climate change projection uncertainty at the local scale: (i) internal
variability uncertainty, i.e., unforced natural climate variability; (ii) forced climate
response uncertainty, i.e., the Earth’s system response to forced natural changes (solar
and volcanic) and human influences (greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, land use
changes etc.); and (iii) emission uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in the emission pathway
humans decide to follow. An interface between MESMER and global mean temperature
emulators can be found at https://github.com/MESMER-group/mesmer-openscmrunner.

MESMER is under active development both scientifically and technically. Future work will
increase its user friendliness and extend its emulation capabilities to include
additional emulation methods and target climate variables.

-------------

Scientific publications using MESMER should cite the following publication:

  temperatures with MESMER: from global mean temperature trajectories to grid-point-level
  realizations on land, Earth Syst. Dynam., 11, 139–159,
  https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-139-2020, 2020.

If MESMER is used to emulate multiple emission pathways and/or in combination with a
global mean emulator, the following publication should additionally be cited:

  computationally efficient emulators: coupling of MAGICC (v7.5.1) and MESMER (v0.8.3),
