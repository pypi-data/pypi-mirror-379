# MCPAgent API Reference

## stream

```python
async def stream(
    query: str,
    max_steps: int | None = None,
    manage_connector: bool = True,
    external_history: list[BaseMessage] | None = None,
) -> AsyncGenerator[tuple[AgentAction, str] | str, None]:
```

Stream agent execution step-by-step. Yields intermediate steps as `(AgentAction, str)` tuples, followed by the final result as a string.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (str): The query to execute
- `max_steps` (int, optional): Maximum number of steps to take
- `manage_connector` (bool): Whether to handle connector lifecycle
- `external_history` (list[BaseMessage], optional): External conversation history

**Yields:**
- `(AgentAction, str)`: Intermediate steps containing the action and observation
- `str`: Final result string

**Example:**

```python
async for item in agent.stream("What's the weather like?"):
    if isinstance(item, str):
        print(f"Final result: {item}")
    else:
        action, observation = item
        print(f"Tool: {action.tool}, Result: {observation}")
```

## run

```python
async def run(
    query: str,
    max_steps: int | None = None,
    manage_connector: bool = True,
    external_history: list[BaseMessage] | None = None,
    output_schema: type[T] | None = None,
) -> str | T:
```

Run agent execution and return the final result. Uses the streaming implementation internally.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (str): The query to execute
- `max_steps` (int, optional): Maximum number of steps to take
- `manage_connector` (bool): Whether to handle connector lifecycle
- `external_history` (list[BaseMessage], optional): External conversation history
- `output_schema` (type[T], optional): Pydantic model for structured output. If provided, the agent will return an instance of this model.

**Returns:**
- `str` | `T`: The final result as a string, or a Pydantic model instance if `output_schema` is provided.

**Examples:**

**Basic Usage**
```python
result = await agent.run("What's the weather like?")
print(result)
```

**Structured Output**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class WeatherInfo(BaseModel):
    temperature: float = Field(description="Temperature in Celsius")
    condition: str = Field(description="Weather condition")

weather: WeatherInfo = await agent.run(
    "What's the weather like in London?",
    output_schema=WeatherInfo
)
print(f"Temperature: {weather.temperature}Â°C, Condition: {weather.condition}")
```

## astream

```python
async def astream(
    query: str,
    max_steps: int | None = None,
    manage_connector: bool = True,
    external_history: list[BaseMessage] | None = None,
) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
```

Asynchronous streaming interface for low-level agent events. Yields incremental results, tool actions, and intermediate steps as they are generated by the agent.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (str): The query to execute
- `max_steps` (int, optional): Maximum number of steps to take
- `manage_connector` (bool): Whether to handle connector lifecycle
- `external_history` (list[BaseMessage], optional): External conversation history

**Yields:**
- `str`: Streaming chunks of the agent's output

**Example:**

```python
async for chunk in agent.astream("hello"):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

## Method Comparison

| Method | Use Case | Output Type | Granularity |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `stream()` | Step-by-step workflow tracking | Steps + final result | Tool-level |
| `run()` | Simple execution | Final result only | Complete |
| `astream()` | Real-time chat interfaces | Streaming chunks | Token-level |

## Conversation Memory

Methods for managing the agent's conversation history.

### get_conversation_history

```python
def get_conversation_history() -> list[BaseMessage]:
```

Retrieves the current conversation history, which is a list of LangChain `BaseMessage` objects. This is useful for inspecting the agent's memory or for passing it to another agent.

**Returns:**
- `list[BaseMessage]`: The list of messages in the conversation history.

### clear_conversation_history

```python
def clear_conversation_history() -> None:
```

Clears the agent's conversation history. This is useful for starting a new conversation without creating a new agent instance. The system message is preserved.

**Example:**
```python
# Run a query, which populates the history
await agent.run("What is the capital of France?")

# Clear the history
agent.clear_conversation_history()

# The next query will not have the context of the first one
await agent.run("What was the last question I asked?")
# Assistant: I'm sorry, I don't have access to our previous conversation.
```

## Agent Management

Methods for managing the agent's lifecycle and configuration.

### set_system_message

```python
def set_system_message(message: str) -> None:
```

Set a new system message for the agent.

### close

```python
async def close() -> None:
```

Close the MCP connection and clean up resources.
