description: "MCP provides a dedicated channel for servers to send log messages to the client, which is separate from the standard notification system. This allows for structured and level-specific logging without cluttering the main message stream."

`mcp-use` supports this feature through a `logging_callback` function that can be passed to the `MCPClient`.

## Server-Side: Sending Logs

On the server (using `fastmcp`), you can send log messages with different severity levels from within a tool's context (`ctx`).

```python filename="server.py"
from fastmcp import Context, FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="PrimitiveServer")

@mcp.tool()
async def logging_tool(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Log a message to the client."""
    await ctx.debug("This is a debug message")
    await ctx.info("This is an info message")
    await ctx.warning("This is a warning message")
    await ctx.error("This is an error message")
    return "Logging tool completed"
```

These log messages are sent as `logging/message` notifications to the client.

## Client-Side: Handling Logs

While you can catch `LoggingMessageNotification` events within the general `message_handler`, the recommended approach is to use the dedicated `logging_callback`. This keeps your code clean by separating logging concerns from other notification handling.

The `logging_callback` receives the parameters of the log notification directly, which include the `level` and `message`.

```python filename="client.py"
import asyncio
import mcp.types as types
from mcp_use import MCPClient

# A dedicated handler for log messages
async def handle_logs(log_params: types.LoggingMessageNotificationParams):
    print(f"LOG [{log_params.level.upper()}]: {log_params.message}")

async def test_logging(primitive_server):
    """Tests receiving logs from the primitive server."""
    config = {"mcpServers": {"PrimitiveServer": {"url": f"{primitive_server}/mcp"}}}
    # Pass the callback to the client
    client = MCPClient(config, logging_callback=handle_logs)
    try:
        await client.create_all_sessions()
        session = client.get_session("PrimitiveServer")

        # This tool will trigger the logging_callback
        result = await session.call_tool(name="logging_tool", arguments={})
        assert result.content[0].text == "Logging tool completed"
    finally:
        await client.close_all_sessions()
```

By using the `logging_callback`, you can easily route server-side logs to your client's logging system, display them in a debug console, or handle them in any other way that suits your application's needs.
