# Goal: Add Semantic-Release Automation

Issue #1: feat: set up automated semantic-release with GitHub Actions

## What We Want to Accomplish
We aim to implement automated release management for the txtpack CLI project using semantic-release. This will streamline the release process by automatically handling version bumps, changelog generation, and git tagging based on conventional commit messages. When changes are merged to the main branch, the system will analyze commit messages, determine the appropriate version increment (patch, minor, or major), update version files, generate changelog entries, and create git tags without manual intervention.

The implementation will integrate with GitHub Actions to provide a seamless CI/CD experience that eliminates manual release overhead while ensuring consistent versioning practices across the project lifecycle.

## Optimization Target
**automation and maintainability** - Optimizing for automation means reducing manual intervention in the release process to near-zero, ensuring releases happen consistently and reliably without human error. Maintainability focuses on creating a sustainable system that future contributors can understand and modify easily, with clear documentation and minimal external dependencies that could break over time.

## Out of Scope
- Publishing packages to PyPI or other package registries (focus only on git-based releases)
- Retrofitting existing commit history to follow conventional commit format
- Setting up release notifications beyond what semantic-release provides by default
- Creating custom release note templates beyond the standard changelog format
- Implementing pre-release or beta release workflows
- Modifying the core CLI functionality or adding new features unrelated to release automation
