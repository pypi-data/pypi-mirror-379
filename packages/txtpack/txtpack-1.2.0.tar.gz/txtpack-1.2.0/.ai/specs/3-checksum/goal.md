# Goal: Add Checksum Validation for File Integrity

## Related Issue
Issue #3: feat: add checksum validation for file integrity

## What We Want to Accomplish
We aim to enhance the txtpack CLI tool with checksum validation capabilities that provide stronger file integrity verification beyond the current byte count validation. This will give users confidence that files extracted during the unpack operation are bit-for-bit identical to the original files that were packed, detecting any data corruption or modification that might occur during file processing, storage, or transmission.

The implementation will extend the existing delimiter format to include checksum information (MD5 or SHA256) alongside the current byte count, while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing packed files. Users will benefit from enhanced reliability in pack/unpack workflows, particularly valuable for critical file operations and long-term storage scenarios.

## Optimization Target
**reliability** - Optimizing for reliability means prioritizing data integrity guarantees, robust error handling, and backward compatibility. We want to ensure that the checksum validation feature works consistently across different file types and sizes, gracefully handles edge cases, and never breaks existing functionality. The implementation should be trustworthy enough for users to depend on for critical file operations while maintaining the tool's existing simplicity and performance characteristics.

## Out of Scope
- Implementing compression or encryption features
- Adding support for other hash algorithms beyond MD5 and SHA256
- Creating a GUI or web interface for the tool
- Implementing parallel processing or multi-threading optimizations
- Adding network transfer capabilities or remote file handling
- Modifying the core pack/unpack workflow beyond checksum integration
- Adding configuration files or complex settings management beyond the hash algorithm selection
- Performance optimizations unrelated to checksum calculation
- Adding progress bars or advanced CLI interface enhancements
