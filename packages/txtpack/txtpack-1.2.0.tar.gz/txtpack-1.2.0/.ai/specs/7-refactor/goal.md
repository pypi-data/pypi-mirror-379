# Goal: Refactor into Unit Testable Chunks and Add Unit Tests

Issue #7: chore: refactor codebase for modularization and unit testability

## What We Want to Accomplish
We will restructure the txtpack codebase to improve modularity and testability by separating concerns and extracting core business logic from CLI interface code. This refactoring will create focused, testable modules that can be easily unit tested in isolation, while maintaining full backward compatibility of the CLI interface.

**Critically, this work includes both the refactoring AND the implementation of comprehensive unit tests.** We will write unit tests for all newly extracted modules, including property-based tests using the hypothesis library to validate round-trip behavior (concat → split → identical files) across various edge cases and input scenarios. The deliverable is not just refactored code, but refactored code with complete unit test coverage.

## Optimization Target
**Maintainability and testability** - Optimizing for maintainability means creating code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend over time. In this context, it involves clear separation of concerns where CLI handling, file I/O operations, pattern matching, and delimiter processing are isolated into distinct, focused modules. Testability optimization means structuring code so that individual components can be tested in isolation without complex setup or external dependencies, enabling comprehensive unit test coverage and reliable validation of core functionality.

## Out of Scope
- Changes to the external CLI interface or user-facing behavior
- Performance optimizations or algorithmic improvements
- New features or functionality beyond the existing concat/split commands
- Changes to configuration file formats or command-line argument structure
- Documentation updates beyond code-level comments
- Integration with external services or APIs
- Refactoring of the build system or CI/CD pipeline
- Migration to different dependencies or frameworks beyond adding hypothesis for testing
