# Goal: Write End-to-End Tests

Issue #2: Add end-to-end testing

## What We Want to Accomplish
We aim to implement comprehensive end-to-end testing for the txtpack CLI tool that validates complete user workflows function correctly. These tests will focus on testing the full CLI commands and their interactions rather than individual code units, ensuring that users can successfully pack and unpack files with byte-accurate preservation.

The e2e tests will validate real-world usage scenarios by invoking actual CLI commands through subprocess calls, testing round-trip file integrity (pack → unpack → verify identical files), and covering various edge cases including different file types, glob patterns, and error scenarios.

## Optimization Target
**User confidence and workflow reliability** - Optimizing for this means ensuring that real user workflows work seamlessly from start to finish. The tests should catch integration issues that unit tests might miss, validate CLI output and error messages that users actually see, and provide confidence that the core value proposition (byte-accurate file bundling/unbundling) works reliably in practice.

## Out of Scope
- Unit test improvements or refactoring existing unit tests
- Code refactoring for better testability (covered in separate issue)
- Performance testing or benchmarking
- Integration with external systems beyond filesystem operations
- Testing internal API methods directly (focus is on CLI interface)
- Documentation updates beyond test code comments
