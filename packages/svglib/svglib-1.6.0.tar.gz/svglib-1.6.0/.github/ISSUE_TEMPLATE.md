If you want to start a discussion rather then open an issue, please use the
now enabled GitHub [discussions feature for this project](https://github.com/deeplook/svglib/discussions)!

When submitting a new issue please try to be as concise and precise as possible.
This means to show only minimal SVG or PDF files that show something unexpected.

In times of widely available files infected with malicious code on the net it
is also appreciated to include bitmap snapshots of your PDFs inside an issue
description or SVG code on a separate, linked GitHub gist.

Otherwise please provide information where relevant like specific versions of
components in your setup, e.g. OS, Python, reportlab, svglib, type of install
or anything else.
