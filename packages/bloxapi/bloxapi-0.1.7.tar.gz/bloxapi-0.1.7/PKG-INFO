# BloxAPI

**Powerful and versatile Python3 wrapper for ROBLOX Web API**

## Installation

```bash
pip install bloxapi
```

## Information

Welcome, and thank you for using BloxAPI!
BloxAPI is an object oriented, asynchronous wrapper for the Roblox Web API (and other Roblox-related APIs) with many new and interesting features.
BloxAPI allows you to automate much of what you would do on the Roblox website and on other Roblox-related websites.

## Get Started

To begin, first import and setup the client, which is the most essential part of BloxAPI, and initialize it like so:

```python
from bloxapi import Client

# Create client instance
client = Client()
```
