# Pyladoc

## Description
Pyladoc is a Python package for programmatically generating HTML and
PDF/LaTeX output. This package specifically targets applications where reports
or results with Pandas tables and Matplotlib figures are generated 
to be displayed as a website and as a PDF document without involving any manual
formatting steps.

This package focuses on the "Document in Code" approach for cases
where a lot of calculations and data handling is done but not a lot of
document text needs to be displayed. The multiline string capability of Python
handles this very well. In comparison to "Code in Document" templates,
Python tools support this approach out of the box—similar to docstrings.

LaTeX is used as the backend for PDF generation. There are excellent engines for
rendering HTML to PDF, but even if there is no requirement for
accurate typesetting, placing programmatically generated content of variable
composition and element sizes on fixed-size pages without manual intervention
is a hard problem where LaTeX is superior.

## Example outputs

[![example output](media/output_example.png)](https://nonannet.github.io/pyladoc/files/test_latex_render1.pdf)

- HTML: [test_html_render1.html](https://nonannet.github.io/pyladoc/files/test_html_render1.html)
- PDF: [test_latex_render1.pdf](https://nonannet.github.io/pyladoc/files/test_latex_render1.pdf) ([LaTeX](https://nonannet.github.io/pyladoc/files/test_html_render1.tex))

The documents are generated by the script [tests/test_rendering_example1_doc.py](tests/test_rendering_example1_doc.py).

### Supported primitives
- Text (can be Markdown or HTML formatted)
- Headings
- Tables (Pandas, Markdown or HTML)
- Matplotlib figures
- LaTeX equations (block or inline)
- Named references for figures, tables, and equations

### Key Features
- HTML and PDF/LaTeX rendering of the same document
- Single file output including figures
- Figure and equation embedding in HTML by inline SVG, SVG in Base64, or PNG in Base64
- Figure embedding in LaTeX as PGF/TikZ
- Tested on Linux and Windows

### Usage Scenarios
- Web services
- Report generation for lab equipment

## Installation
It can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install pyladoc
```

As well as with conda:
```bash
conda install conda-forge::pyladoc
```

## Dependencies
Pyladoc depends on the markdown package.

Optional dependencies are:
- Matplotlib Python package for rendering LaTeX equations for HTML output
- LaTeX for exporting to PDF or exporting Matplotlib figures to LaTeX (PGF/TikZ rendering)
- Pandas and Jinja2 for rendering Pandas tables
- Matplotlib for rendering Matplotlib figures (obviously)

For the included template, the `miktex` LaTeX distribution works on Windows
and the following LaTeX setup works on Ubuntu (both tested in CI):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended lmodern texlive-xetex texlive-science
```

## Usage
It is easy to use, as the following example code shows:

```python
import pyladoc
import pandas as pd

doc = pyladoc.DocumentWriter()

doc.add_markdown("""
    # Example
    This is inline LaTeX: $$\\lambda$$

    This is a LaTeX block with a number:
    $$
    \\label{eq:test1}
    \\lambda_{\text{mix}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{x_i \\lambda_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \\Phi_{ij}}
    $$

    This is an example table. The table @table:pandas_example shows some random data.
    """)

some_data = {
    'Row1': ["Line1", "Line2", "Line3"],
    'Row2': [120, 100, 110],
    'Row3': ['12 g/km', '> 150 g/km', '110 g/km']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(some_data)
doc.add_table(df, 'This is a pandas example table', 'pandas_example')

html_code = doc.to_html()
print(html_code)

doc.to_pdf('test.pdf')
```

## Developer Guide
To get started with developing the `pyladoc` package, follow these steps.

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nonannet/pyladoc.git
cd pyladoc
```

It's recommended to set up a venv:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the package and development dependencies while keeping files in the
current directory:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Ensure that everything is set up correctly by running the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
