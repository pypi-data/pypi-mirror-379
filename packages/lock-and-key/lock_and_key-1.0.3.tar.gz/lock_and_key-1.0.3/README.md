## Quick Start

### Installation

```console
# Basic installation
pip install lock-and-key

# With enhanced AWS support (better IDE experience)
pip install lock-and-key[aws]

# For developers (includes testing and linting tools)
pip install lock-and-key[dev]

# Everything included
pip install lock-and-key[all]
```

### Run Your First Scan

```console
# Interactive mode (recommended for first-time users)
lock-and-key interactive

# Direct AWS scan with profile
lock-and-key scan --provider AWS --profile my-profile
```

**Need help with setup?** Check out the **[Installation Guide](https://thewintershadow.github.io/Lock-And-Key/installation.html)** for detailed instructions.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run the interactive scanner to select providers and enter credentials:

```console
lock-and-key interactive
```

### Direct Scan Mode

Scan a specific provider with credentials:

```console
# AWS with profile
lock-and-key scan --provider AWS --profile my-profile

# AWS with access keys
lock-and-key scan --provider AWS --access-key YOUR_KEY --secret-key YOUR_SECRET --region us-east-1

# Azure (in progress)
lock-and-key scan --provider Azure --client-id YOUR_ID --secret YOUR_SECRET --tenant-id YOUR_TENANT

# GCP (in progress)
lock-and-key scan --provider GCP --creds-path /path/to/service-account.json
```

### Options

- `--output-dir`: Specify output directory for reports (default: `./reports`)
- `--provider`: Choose cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Various credential options for each provider

## Security Checks

Lock & Key identifies the following security issues:

- **Administrative Permissions**: Policies with `*:*` actions
- **Wildcard Resources**: Policies allowing access to all resources (`*`)
- **Privilege Escalation**: IAM permissions that could lead to privilege escalation
- **Overly Broad Access**: Resource policies with excessive permissions
- **Cross-Account Access**: Policies allowing external account access

## Report Format

Reports are generated in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "provider": "AWS",
  "account_id": "123456789012",
  "issues_found": 15,
  "least_privilege_violations": 8,
  "high_risk_permissions": 3,
  "summary": "Scanned IAM and all resource policies. Found 15 security issues.",
  "findings": [
    {
      "resource_name": "MyPolicy",
      "resource_id": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyPolicy",
      "issue_type": "Excessive Permissions",
      "severity": "High",
      "description": "Administrative permissions (*:*) detected",
      "recommendation": "Replace wildcard permissions with specific actions"
    }
  ]
}
```
