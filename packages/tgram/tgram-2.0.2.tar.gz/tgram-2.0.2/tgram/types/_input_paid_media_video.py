    The paid media to send is a video.

    Telegram documentation: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inputpaidmediavideo

    :param type: Type of the media, must be video
    :type type: :obj:`str`

    :param media: File to send. Pass a file_id to send a file that exists on the Telegram servers (recommended), pass an HTTP URL for
        Telegram to get a file from the Internet, or pass “attach://<file_attach_name>” to upload a new one using multipart/form-data
        under <file_attach_name> name. More information on Sending Files »
    :type media: :obj:`str`

    :param thumbnail: Optional. Thumbnail of the file sent; can be ignored if thumbnail generation for the file is supported server-side.
        The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 kB in size. A thumbnail's width and height should not exceed 320.
        Ignored if the file is not uploaded using multipart/form-data. Thumbnails can't be reused and can be only uploaded as a new file,
        so you can pass “attach://<file_attach_name>” if the thumbnail was uploaded using multipart/form-data under <file_attach_name>.
