`EasyBuild <https://easybuild.io>`_ is a software build
and installation framework that allows you to manage (scientific) software
on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient way.

The **easybuild-easyblocks** package provides a collection of *easyblocks* for
EasyBuild. Easyblocks are Python modules that implement the install procedure for a
(group of) software package(s). Together with the EasyBuild framework,
they allow to easily build and install supported software packages.

The EasyBuild documentation is available at http://docs.easybuild.io/.

The easybuild-easyblocks source code is hosted on GitHub, along
with an issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests, see
https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks.
