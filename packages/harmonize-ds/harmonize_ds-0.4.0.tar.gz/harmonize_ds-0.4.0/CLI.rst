Running Harmonize Datasources Client in the Command Line
========================================================

The ``Harmonize Datasources`` client installs a command line tool named ``harmonizeds-cli`` that allows to retrieve trajectory data.


If you want to know the Harmonize Datasources version, use the option ``--version`` as in::

    harmonizeds-cli --version


List the available collections::

    harmonizeds-cli collections 


To get more information about a specific collection, use the ``describe`` command::

    harmonizeds-cli describe --id 'bdc_lcc-wfs' --collection_id 'bdc_lcc:anomaly_cdays_temp_max_ne_mun_epiweek'


Retrieve the trajectory given a longitude and latitude::

    harmonize-ds download --collection_id 'bdc_lcc:zika_cases_north_mun_week' --id 'bdc_lcc-wfs' --filename '/path/obs.shp' --filter '{"date": "2017-01-01"}' --verbose
