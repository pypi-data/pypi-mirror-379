# mathInterval

C++ interval arithmetic exposed to Python.  
It can also be used directly in C++.

This module provides classes and algorithms for working
with mathematical intervals (multitudes). It supports:

- Construction of intervals with finite or infinite bounds.
- Smart search algorithms using user-provided lambdas.
- Conversion and custom transfer of interval data.
- Execution of arithmetic operators between intervals.

All classes and functions include Python-style docstrings,
which can be viewed via `help()` in a Python console.

In C++, each function is documented directly in the header
(`interval.h`) before its declaration.

## Installation

### C++

Copy the `interval.h` file to your project and include it
using standard C++ mechanisms (`#include "interval.h"`).

### Python

The package may be downloaded on PyPI. Also, you can build
and install library manually:

> ⚠️ Before building, make sure that the **build** module for `pip` is installed:
> ```bash
> pip install build
> ```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fedorrracora/mathInterval --recurse-submodules
cd mathInterval
python -m build
pip install dist/*.whl
```

### Tip:

To build a universal wheel you may use:

```bash
cibuildwheel --platform auto
```

## Uninstallation (Python)

```bash
pip uninstall mathInterval
```
