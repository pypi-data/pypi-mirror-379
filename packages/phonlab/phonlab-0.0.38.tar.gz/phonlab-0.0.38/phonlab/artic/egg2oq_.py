    """Get glottal open quotient from electroglottography data
    
    Extract fundamental frequency of voice (f0) and glottal open quotient (OQ) 
    at equally spaced intervals in a recording of electroglottography (a stereo 
    file).  OQ is calcuated with the 'hybrid' method (Herbst, 2020). Preprocessing 
    filtering method follows Rothenberg (2002).
    

    Parameters
    ==========
        
        x : ndarray
            A one-dimensional array of samples in an electroglottograph waveform
        fs : int
            the sampling rate of **x**
        hop_dur : float, default = 0.005
            interval in seconds between frames (0.005 seconds = 5 milliseconds)
        f0_range : list of two integers, default = [63,400]
            The lowest and highest allowed values of f0.
        hp_cut : int, default = 70 
            highpass filter cut frequency (in Hz) (Rothenberg, 2002)
        hp_order : int, default = 8
            highpass filter order (Rothenberg, 2002)
        threshold : float, default = 0.43
            threshold between 0 and 1, on the EGG signal for glottal opening instant (Herbst, 2020)
        
    Returns
    =======
        df : DataFrame
            Open quotient and f0 results in a Pandas dataframe.

    Note
    ====
        The returned Pandas dataframe has columns:
        
            * sec - midpoint times (seconds) of the analysis frames in f0 and OQ
            * OQ - the glottal open quotient as a function of time.
            * f0 - estimates of the fundamental frequency of voicing as a function of time
