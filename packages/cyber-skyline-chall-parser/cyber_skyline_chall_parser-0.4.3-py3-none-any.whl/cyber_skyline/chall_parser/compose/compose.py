Docker Compose File Structure for CTF Challenges

This module defines a simplified Docker Compose file structure specifically designed
for CTF challenge deployment. It enforces security constraints and validation while
supporting the x-challenge extension for CTF-specific metadata.

# Deliberately excluded Docker Compose features:
# - volumes: Persistent storage could be a security risk and complexity issue
# - secrets: We handle secrets through our own variable system
# - configs: Configuration is handled through environment variables and templates

# Design Decisions:
#
# 1. Security First: Many standard Docker Compose features are excluded
#    to reduce attack surface. External network access, volume mounts,
#    and privileged operations are not supported.
#
# 2. CTF-Specific: The required challenge field makes this format
#    specifically for CTF challenges, not general container orchestration.
#
# 3. Validation: All resource names are validated to prevent injection
#    attacks and ensure cross-platform compatibility.
#
# 4. Simplicity: Only essential Docker Compose features are supported
#    to reduce complexity and potential configuration errors.
#
# Usage example:
# challenge:
#   name: "Web Security Challenge"
#   description: "Find the SQL injection vulnerability"
#   questions:
#     - name: "flag"
#       question: "What is the admin password?"
#       points: 100
#       answer: "admin123"
#       max_attempts: 5
#
# services:
#   web:
#     image: "challenge/web-vuln:latest"
#     hostname: "web-server"
#     environment:
#       - "DB_HOST=database"
#   database:
#     image: "postgres:13"
#     hostname: "db-server"
#     environment:
#       - "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret"
#
# networks:
#   challenge-net:
#     internal: true
#   database:
