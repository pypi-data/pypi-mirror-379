Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

ILWISPy is a Geo-Processing Tool which can be used as a site-package under Python. The main objective of ILWISPy is to 'achieve more with less coding' and 'increase flexibility'. ILWISPy has a large library of commonly used GIS and RS operations which can be easily coded through single line statements. The core is based on C++ and is fast. This capability, together with other Python sitepackages, offers great flexibility in data retrieval, (pre-) processing and analysis, far exceeding those offered through Graphical User Interface (GUI) Geo-processing tools.

ILWISPy can be directly imported in Python, but can also be used within a Jupyter Notebook, offering the capability of markdown text with explanations and subsequent coding fields to execute certain operations, which for educational purposes offers nice opportunities.
