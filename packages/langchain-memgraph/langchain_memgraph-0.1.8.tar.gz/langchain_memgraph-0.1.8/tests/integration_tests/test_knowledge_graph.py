        Charles Robert Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist,
        widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology. His proposition that
        all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally
        accepted and considered a fundamental scientific concept. In a joint
        publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that
        this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural
        selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the
        artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been
        described as one of the most influential figures in human history and was
        honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.
