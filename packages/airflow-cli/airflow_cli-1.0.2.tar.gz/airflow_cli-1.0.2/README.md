# Airflow Docker CLI

A command-line tool to facilitate the setup of Apache Airflow using Docker and enable local DAG development and testing.

## Features

- 🚀 Quick Airflow setup with Docker Compose
- 🔧 Local DAG development and testing
- 📦 Pre-configured Docker environment
- 🛠️ CLI interface for common Airflow operations
- 🧪 Testing utilities for DAG validation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install airflow-cli
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Start Airflow Environment

```bash
actl up
```

This command will:

- Check Docker installation and environment
- Create last docker-compose.yml
- Start Airflow services with Docker Compose

### 2. Access Airflow UI

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

Default credentials:

- Username: `airflow`
- Password: `airflow`

### 3. Stop Airflow Environment

```bash
actl down
```

## Usage

### Available Commands

```bash
# Start Docker environment
actl up

# Stop Docker environment
actl down

# Run Airflow DAG inside Docker
actl run

# Run flake8 linter on DAGs
actl fix

# Show help
actl --help
```

### DAG Development

1. Place your DAG files in the `dags/` directory
2. The directory is automatically mounted to the Airflow container
3. Changes are reflected immediately (no restart required)

Expected DAG structure for `run-dag` command:

```
project/
├── dags/
│   └── my_dag/
│       ├── config.yml
│       └── dag.py

```

Example `config.yml`:

```yaml
args:
  id: "my_dag_id"
```

### Testing DAGs

#### Run a DAG inside Docker

```bash
actl run
```

This command will:

- Look for DAG configuration files in `dags/*/config.yml`
- Execute the DAG inside the running Airflow container

#### Validate DAG syntax with flake8

```bash
actl fix
```

This will run flake8 linter on the `dags/` folder to check for Python syntax issues.

### Building from Source

```bash
# Build wheel
python -m build

# Install built package
pip install dist/airflow_cli-*.whl
```
