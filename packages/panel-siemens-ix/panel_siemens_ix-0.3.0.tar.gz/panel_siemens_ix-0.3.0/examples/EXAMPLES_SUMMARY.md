## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns Used

### Parameter-Driven Design
All examples follow Panel's recommended parameter-driven architecture:
- Use of `pn.viewable.Viewer` or `param.Parameterized` base classes
- Widget creation with `.from_param()` method
- Reactive methods with `@param.depends()`
- Proper parameter documentation and type hints

### Layout Patterns
- **Static Layout + Reactive Content**: Create layout once, update content dynamically
- **Responsive Design**: Use Material UI breakpoints (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`)
- **Container Usage**: Proper use of `pmui.Container` for centering and responsive behavior
- **Grid Layouts**: Use of `pmui.Row` and `pmui.Column` for structured layouts

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Use of `@pn.cache` for expensive data operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components created once and updated reactively
- **Efficient Updates**: Avoid recreating components in reactive methods

### User Experience Patterns
- **Validation**: Real-time validation with visual feedback
- **Notifications**: Success, error, and info notifications for user actions
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and disabled states
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant color contrasts and semantic HTML
