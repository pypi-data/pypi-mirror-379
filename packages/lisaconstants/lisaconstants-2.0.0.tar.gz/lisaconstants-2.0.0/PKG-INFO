# LISA Constants

LISA Constants is a Python package providing values sanctioned by the LISA
Science Ground Segment (SGS) for physical constants and mission parameters. LISA
Constants is intended to be consistently used by other pieces of software
related to the simulation of the instrument, of gravitational wave signals, and
others.

We provide support for Python projects (as a package), C projects (as a header
file), and C++ projects (as a header file). See below how to use the package.

## Contributing

### Report an issue

We use the issue-tracking management system associated with the project provided
by Gitlab. If you want to report a bug or request a feature, open an issue at
<https://gitlab.esa.int/lisa-sgs/commons/lisa-constants/-/issues>. You may also
thumb-up or comment on existing issues.

### Development environment

We strongly recommend to use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage your
development environment. To clone and setup the project, use the following
commands:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.esa.int/lisa-sgs/commons/lisa-constants.git
cd lisa-constants
poetry install
```

### Workflow

The project's development workflow is based on the issue-tracking system
provided by Gitlab, as well as peer-reviewed merge requests. This ensures
high-quality standards.

Issues are solved by creating branches and opening merge requests. Only the
assignee of the related issue and merge request can push commits on the branch.
Once all the changes have been pushed, the "draft" specifier on the merge
request is removed, and the merge request is assigned to a reviewer. He can push
new changes to the branch, or request changes to the original author by
re-assigning the merge request to them. When the merge request is accepted, the
branch is merged onto master, deleted, and the associated issue is closed.

### Pylint and unittest

We enforce [PEP 8 (Style Guide for Python
Code)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with Pylint syntax checking,
and correction of the code using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) testing
framework. Both are implemented in the continuous integration system.

You can run them locally

```shell
pylint lisaconstants
python -m pytest
```

## Use policy

The project is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD open-source license to foster
open science in our community and share common tools. Please keep in mind that
developing and maintaining such a tool takes time and effort. Therefore, we
kindly ask you to

* Cite the DOI (see badge above) in any publication
* Acknowledge the authors (below)
* Acknowledge the LISA Simulation Expert Group in any publication

Do not hesitate to send an email to the authors for support. We always
appreciate being associated with research projects.
