```bash
# Format code with Black
black app/

# Sort imports with isort
isort app/

# Check code style with flake8
flake8 app/

# Type checking with mypy
mypy app/
```

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any
from datetime import datetime
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field, Relationship
from enum import Enum

class AccountStatus(str, Enum):
    """Account status enumeration."""
    ONLINE = "online"
    OFFLINE = "offline"
    ERROR = "error"

class Account(SQLModel, table=True):
    """Account model for storing Telegram account information."""
    
    id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    phone_number: str = Field(unique=True, index=True)
    username: Optional[str] = None
    status: AccountStatus = AccountStatus.OFFLINE
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    
    def is_online(self) -> bool:
        """Check if account is online."""
        return self.status == AccountStatus.ONLINE
    
    def get_display_name(self) -> str:
