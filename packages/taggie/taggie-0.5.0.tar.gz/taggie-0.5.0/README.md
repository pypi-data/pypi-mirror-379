Assign tags to repositories based on their contents.

## About

taggie tags things. It's what it does.

taggie is built as a standalone tool to be integrated into a larger toolchain
for analyzing and acting on project contents.

## Installation

```sh
python3 -m pip install taggie
```

## Usage

### Use the default tags

Run `taggie` with no options to use the default collection of tag files bundled
with the application:

```sh
taggie
```

```console
$ taggie
TOTAL    NAME              EXAMPLE
243      yaml              marp/.gitlab-ci.yml
52       markdown          container/README.md
15       opentofu          opentofu/outputs.tf
11       jinja             container/.cici/README.md.j2
9        python            python/examples/dynamic-version/python_pipeline/__init__.py
6        toml              python/examples/dynamic-version/pyproject.toml
3        html              zola/templates/index.html
1        restructuredtext  sphinx/docs/index.rst
1        css               marp/style.css
```

### Use your own tags

Define a set of tagging rules in YAML files we like to call "tag files":

```yaml
# jinja.yaml
- type: file.extension
  tags:
    - jinja
  extensions:
    - j2
```

The syntax is a little verbose, but that's because we want to make the tagging
components pluggable.

Run `taggie` with the `-t`/`--tag-file` option to specify your tag files. A
directory can also be passed. `-t`/`--tag-file` can be specified as many times
as needed:

```sh
taggie -t jinja.yaml
```

```console
$ taggie -t jinja.yaml
TOTAL    NAME    EXAMPLE
11       jinja   gitlab/.cici/README.md.j2
```
