# Ride-The-Duck

Ride The Duck is a gambling, CLI, binary executable game based on the drinking game "Ride The Bus". Ride The Duck incorporates the first stage of Ride The Bus, where you need to guess if the next card fits into either category, with each category giving you a better multiplier to your initial bet, earning you more.

## Features

Ride The Duck contains many different features:

- Save file: When exiting the terminal or the game, your data (money, name, stats) will be saved.
- CLI: The game appears and runs on the Command Line Interface for a tech and hacky vibe.
- ASCII: Part of the game's interface is made using ASCII, which gives a cool visual effect.
- ANSI escape codes: The game's text is configured with colour to pop out.
- Gambling: You are given money to gamble with, for fun.

## How Does Ride The Duck Work?

When you play the main game, you first need to insert how much you want to bet. After you complete the bet stage, there are 4 rounds, each round giving you a better multiplier for your money.

1. Red or Black x2

2. Over or Under x3

3. Inside or Outside x4

4. Suit x20

After completing each stage, you're able to cash out and collect your bet with the multiplier of the round or continue and try to collect a higher multiplier.

The first round is guessing if the next/first card is going to be Red or Black. Completing this will give you a 2x multiplier on your initial bet.
The second round is guessing if the next card is going to be over or under the first card. Completing this will give you a 3x multiplier on your initial bet.
The third round is guessing if the next card is going to be between the first 2 cards or outside them. Completing this will give you a 4x multiplier on your initial bet.
Lastly, the fourth round is guessing the suit of the next/last card. Completing this will give you a 20x multiplier on your initial bet.

On the last stage, you can only cash out, earning the holy 20x multiplier.

## How to play

### Binary Executable (MacOS arm 64 ONLY)

To download the binary executable (TERMINAL CRAFT), you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the  releases page of Ride The Duck

2. Go to the most recent version and download the file: "RTD-G '*VERSION*' MacOS arm64 tar.gz". This is the file that has the game on it.

3. Go to the file location (most probably 'downloads') and open the downloaded file.

4. Bypass the Apple security by:

    - Double click the "RTD-Game" executable file and press "Done" (NOT "Move to Bin"). Go to Settings > Privacy & Security and under Security, select Open Anyway on the game file name "RTD-Game".

    **or**

   - Go to your terminal and insert the file directory where the file is -
    Example:

    ```sh
    cd /Users/MyUserNAME/downloads 
    ```

   - Then use this command to bypass the security -

    ```sh
    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine RTD-Game
    ```

5. Double click or open the game executable file and have fun c:

If you're not comfortable with letting your guard down and bypassing the security, you can message me on Slack (Soon to be changed tho) [@DuckyBoi_XD](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U08TJ79P0G4) or [Email](braedenjairsytan@icloud.com) and I'll try to respond asap to send you the file that shouldn't require any security bypass
