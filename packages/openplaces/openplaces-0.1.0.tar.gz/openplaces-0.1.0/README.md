**openplaces** is an open-source data and analytics platform for integrating parcel boundaries, environmental indicators, and socio‑economic data at scale.

Maintained by researchers at academic institutions and released under the **Apache-2.0** license, it supports reproducible research for conservation, land policy, and environmental analytics.

This repository is an inital commit with a sceleton structure and will be populated with code from sister projects 2025-2026.

## ✨ Features (goals)

- Standardized **parcel-level** data ingestion and harmonization.
- Connectors to **remote-sensing archives** (Landsat (LS), Sentinel, NAIP) and environmental datasets.
- Utilities for **valuation modeling**, **conservation planning**, and spatial statistics.
- Cloud/cluster-friendly workflows for **reproducibility** (containers, CI, distributed compute).
- Modern Python stack (GeoPandas, Rasterio, Xarray, Dask, Scikit‑learn/PyTorch).

> The snippet below is illustrative for intended use — consult the docs for the current interface.

```python
import openplaces as op

# Load parcels for Middlesex, Massachusetts, United States
parcels = op.load_parcels("US-MA-MI")

# Join satellite-derived forest change
parcels = op.join_forest_change(parcels)

# Get sales dataset for hedonic analysis
sales = op.get_sales(parcels)

# Estimate land values
values = op.estimate_land_values(parcels)
print(values.describe())
```
