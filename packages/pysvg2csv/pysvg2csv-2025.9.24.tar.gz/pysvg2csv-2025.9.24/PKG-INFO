# PySvg2Csv

```sh
pip3 install tex2svg
```

## Introduction

PySvg2Csv is a package for graphic object conversion and data transformation with Python. This simple program converts graphic paths from an SVG file to a corresponding CSV data file and equivalent Bézier paths
used by LaTeX's Postscript package
[pstricks](https://ctan.org/pkg/pstricks-base?lang=en).

It provides:

- a powerful data extraction and format conversion capabilities
- sophisticated (transformation) functions
- tools for integrating LaTeX, PostScript, and JavaScript  code

## Description

The `path` element is the most powerful element in the SVG library of basic shapes. It can be used to create lines, curves, arcs, and more. There are three different commands that can be used to create smooth curves. Two of those curves are Bézier curves, and the third is an "arc" or part of a circle. There are an infinite number of Bézier curves, but only two are available in `path` elements: a cubic one, called with `C`, and a quadratic one, called with `Q`. A Bézier curve is a mathematically defined, smooth curve used in computer graphics, design, and animation, determined by a set of discrete control points. These control points dictate the curve's shape, with the curve passing through the first and last points but being "pulled" toward the intermediate points. The cubic curve, C, also known as the Cubic Bézier take in two control points for each point. Therefore, to create a cubic Bézier, three sets of coordinates need to be specified. Including the starting point there are four points for any given cubic Bézier path. The endever is to extract these points for every path in the SVG file and store them as CSV data and LaTeX PSTricks commands.

## Quick Start

```python
from pysvg2csv.svg2csv import *

node_coords = extract_node_coordinates("data-svg/weapon-trident-01.svg")
print("Node Coordinates:", *node_coords, sep='\n')

latex_paths = create_latex_paths(node_coords)
print("LaTeX Paths:", *latex_paths, sep='\n')
```

## Testing


PySvg2Csv requires `pytest` and `pytest-cov`.  Tests can then be run after installation with:

```sh
pytest
pytest --cache-clear
pytest --cov=your_module_or_directory
pytest --cov=tests --cov-report=html:coverage_html_report
```
