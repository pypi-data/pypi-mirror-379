# PySvg2Csv

**Amit M. Manthanwar** _25 September 2025_

```sh
pip install pysvg2csv
```

## Introduction

PySvg2Csv is a package for graphic object conversion and data transformation with Python. This simple program converts graphic paths from an SVG file to a corresponding CSV data and equivalent Bézier paths used by LaTeX and PostScript.

It provides:

- a powerful data extraction and format conversion capabilities
- sophisticated (transformation) functions
- tools for integrating LaTeX, PostScript, and JavaScript  code

## Description

The `path` element is the most powerful element in the SVG library of basic shapes. It can be used to create lines, curves, arcs, and more. There are three different commands that can be used to create smooth curves. Two of those curves are Bézier curves, and the third is an "arc" or part of a circle. There are an infinite number of Bézier curves, but only two are available in `path` elements: a cubic one, called with `C`, and a quadratic one, called with `Q`. A Bézier curve is a mathematically defined, smooth curve used in computer graphics, design, and animation, determined by a set of discrete control points. These control points dictate the curve's shape, with the curve passing through the first and last points but being "pulled" toward the intermediate points. The cubic curve, C, also known as the Cubic Bézier take in two control points for each point. Therefore, to create a cubic Bézier, three sets of coordinates need to be specified. Including the starting point, there are four points for any given cubic Bézier path. The endeavor is to extract these points for every path in the SVG file and store them as CSV data and LaTeX PSTricks commands.

## Quick Start

### Example 1: file containing three curves

![Simple Curves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manthanwar/PySvg2Csv/refs/heads/main/data/curves.svg)


```python
from pysvg2csv.svg2csv import *

node_coords = extract_node_coordinates("data-svg/curves.svg")
print("Node Coordinates:", *node_coords, sep='\n')

latex_paths = create_latex_paths(node_coords)
print("LaTeX Paths:", *latex_paths, sep='\n')
```

### Example 2: file containing multiple Bézier paths

![Trident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manthanwar/PySvg2Csv/refs/heads/main/data/trident.svg)

```python
from pysvg2csv.svg2csv import *

node_coords = extract_node_coordinates("data-svg/trident.svg")
print("Node Coordinates:", *node_coords, sep='\n')

latex_paths = create_latex_paths(node_coords)
print("LaTeX Paths:", *latex_paths, sep='\n')
```

The SVG files used in the above examples are located in the project's data folder.

## Testing

PySvg2Csv requires `pytest` and `pytest-cov`.  Tests can then be run after installation with any one of the following command of your choice:

```sh
pytest
pytest --cache-clear
pytest --cov=tests
pytest --cov=tests --cov-report=html:coverage_html_report
```
