m1: "The value in this field is not expressed in compliance with the syntax of OpenCitations CITS-CSV/META-CSV. The content of 'citing_id'/'cited_id' (for CITS-CSV) or 'id' (for META-CSV) must be either a single ID or a sequence of IDs, each separated by one single space character (Unicode Character SPACE, U+0020). Each ID must not have spaces within itself, and must be of the following form: <ID abbreviation> + : + <ID value>."
m2: "The value in this field is not expressed in compliance with the syntax of OpenCitations CITS-CSV/META-CSV. Each identifier in 'citing_id'/'cited_id' (for CITS-CSV) or 'id' (for META-CSV) must have the following form: <ID abbreviation> + ':' + <ID value>. No spaces are admitted within the ID. Example: doi:10.48550/arXiv.2206.03971. The accepted prefixes (ID abbreviations) are the following: 'doi', 'issn', 'isbn', 'pmid', 'pmcid', 'url', 'wikidata', 'wikipedia', 'openalex', 'jid', 'arxiv', 'omid' (and 'temp' or 'local' for temporary identifiers used for deduplication in case a publication lacks a persistent ID)."
