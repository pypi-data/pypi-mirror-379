        <p class="counter-par"><b>There are <span class="error-counter">{{ error_count }}</span> errors/warnings in the table submitted for validation.</b></p>
        <p>The parts of the table that did not validate are marked by an underlining and immediately followed by a coloured square. Data that did not validate is divided into 2 categories: data involved in an Error and data involved in a Warning. An Error prevents the whole row containing it to be processed by the OpenCitations software; a Warning represents the need for the user to manually double-check the interested data, as it is not possible to automatically determine its correctness. Data involving an <span style="background-color: LightCoral">Error</span> is marked by a <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: LightCoral">red underline</span>, data involving a <span style="background-color: orange">Warning</span> is marked by an <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: orange">orange underline</span>.</p>
        <p>Each single coloured square represents the association between an Error/Warning and a single piece of data (immediately preceding it in the document). Squares of the same colour all represent the same error instance. Therefore, an error that involves multiple parts of the table will be represented by as many squares as the number of involved parts.</p>
        <p>To get an explanation of an Error/Warning, hover with the mouse cursor over any of the squares that represent it. If you click on it, all the data involved in the Error/Warning will be highlighted.</p>
