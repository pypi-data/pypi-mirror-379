# TFActProfiler

**TFActProfiler** provides tools to infer transcription factor (TF) activities from gene expression data, assess their reliability, and simulate perturbation effects with or without additional model training.

## Features
1. **TF activity inference with reliability estimation**  
   - `estimate_reliability`: Computes activity scores for transcription factors and estimates their reliability 
   
2. **Perturbation simulation without additional training**  
   - `perturbation_predict`: Predicts the effects of TF perturbations (e.g., knockout) directly from prior TFâ€“target interaction networks and observed expression data.  
   - No extra model fitting required.
   
3. **Perturbation simulation with additional training**  
   - `train_W`, `predict_withW`: Learns gene expression changes to predict TF perturbations.


## Installation
```bash
pip install tfactprofiler
```
