What is BioSTEAM?
-----------------

BioSTEAM is a fast and flexible package for the design, simulation, 
techno-economic analysis, and life cycle assessment of biorefineries under uncertainty [1]_. 
BioSTEAM is built to streamline and automate early-stage technology evaluations 
and to enable rigorous sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Complete 
biorefinery configurations are available at the `Bioindustrial-Park 
<https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park>`_ GitHub repository, 
BioSTEAM's premier repository for biorefinery models and results. The long-term 
growth and maintenance of BioSTEAM is supported through both community-led 
development and the research institutions invested in BioSTEAM, including the 
`Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovations (CABBI) <https://cabbi.bio/>`_. 
Through its open-source and community-lead platform, BioSTEAM aims to foster 
communication and transparency within the biorefinery research community for an 
integrated effort to expedite the evaluation of candidate biofuels and 
bioproducts.

Data on chemicals and algorithms to estimate thermodynamic properties are 
imported from `chemicals <https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals>`_
and `thermo <https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals>`_,
community-driven open-source libraries developed by Caleb Bell. BioSTEAM's 
premire thermodynamic engine, `ThermoSTEAM <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/thermosteam>`_, 
builds upon these libraries to facilitate the creation of thermodynamic property packages.
