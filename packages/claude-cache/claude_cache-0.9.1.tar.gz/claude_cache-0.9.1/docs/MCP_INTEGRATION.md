# Claude Cache MCP Integration 🚀

## Native Claude Code Tools for Lightning-Fast Development

Version 0.9.0 introduces **Intelligent MCP** integration with truly smart pattern detection. Claude Cache tools are now available directly in Claude Code as native slash commands with behavioral understanding!

## 🎯 What This Means

Instead of:
1. Opening terminal
2. Running `cache query`
3. Copying results
4. Pasting into Claude

Now you just:
- Type `/cache_query` in Claude Code
- Get instant intelligent results with behavioral understanding
- Claude Cache auto-saves successful patterns based on your behavior
- Patterns suggested proactively based on conversation context!

## ⚡ Available Tools

### `cache_query`
**Intelligent Pattern Search** - Context-aware search with behavioral understanding
```
Arguments:
- what: Natural language description of what you're looking for
- smart: Use intelligent context-aware search (default: True)

Examples:
- cache_query("how did I handle auth in React")
- cache_query("that database connection issue from last week")
- cache_query("tests failing", smart=True)
```

### `cache_analyze`
**Real-Time Session Analysis** - See what Claude Cache is learning
```
Shows current conversation analysis:
- Success detection with confidence levels
- Pattern quality assessment (Gold/Silver/Bronze/Anti)
- Multi-signal evidence breakdown
- Smart recommendations

No arguments needed - analyzes current session automatically
```

### `cache_save`
**Smart Pattern Saving** - Save successful solutions with intelligence
```
Arguments:
- confirm: Whether to save (default: True, set False to skip)

Features:
- Auto-detects success patterns from conversation
- Saves with quality classification
- Includes behavioral evidence
- Called automatically on high confidence detection
```

### `cache_suggest`
**Proactive Intelligence** - Context-aware recommendations
```
Provides suggestions based on:
- Current conversation context
- Similar past problems
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Your coding phase (exploration vs implementation)

No arguments needed - uses conversation context automatically
```

### `cache_stats`
**Intelligence Dashboard** - Your learning progress
```
Shows:
- Total patterns with quality distribution
- Auto-save statistics
- Current session status
- Detection capabilities

No arguments needed - shows comprehensive overview
```

## 🔧 Setup (One-Time)

### 1. Install Claude Cache with MCP
```bash
pip install claude-cache[mcp]
# or if already installed:
pip install --upgrade claude-cache
```

### 2. Configure Claude Code

Add to your project's `.claude.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cache": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "cache-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Or globally in `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cache": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "cache-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Claude Code

The tools will appear when you type `/` in Claude Code!

## 🧠 Intelligent v0.9.0 Features

### 🤖 **Multi-Signal Detection**
Combines 4 analysis techniques for accurate pattern detection:
1. **Conversation Flow** - Understands problem-solving progression
2. **Execution Results** - Prioritizes test passes and build success
3. **User Intent** - Analyzes what you're actually trying to do
4. **Behavioral Patterns** - Recognizes "AI says done + user moves on = success"

### 💡 **Behavioral Understanding**
- **Implicit Success Detection**: When Claude completes a task and you move to the next one
- **Context Awareness**: Knows if you're exploring or implementing
- **Smart Auto-Save**: High confidence patterns saved without asking
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Continuous conversation understanding

### 🎯 **Advanced Pattern Classification**
- **Gold**: Worked immediately with high confidence
- **Silver**: Good solution after some iteration
- **Bronze**: Eventually worked
- **Anti**: Confirmed failures to avoid

### 🚀 **Semantic Understanding**
With sentence-transformers installed, Claude Cache understands context:
- "auth bug" finds authentication-related fixes
- "speed up database" finds performance optimizations
- "test failing" finds testing solutions
- "that React hook issue from yesterday" finds specific past problems

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Intelligent Pattern Search
```
You: cache_query("JWT authentication issues")
Claude Cache: 🔍 Found 3 relevant patterns:

1. 🎯 JWT validation with refresh tokens (Perfect match)
   Solution: Use httpOnly cookies with rotation
   Match: 95% | Quality: gold

2. ⚠️ Don't store JWT in localStorage (Anti-pattern)
   Avoid: Security vulnerability

3. ✨ OAuth2 implementation pattern (Good solution)
   Solution: Redirect flow with PKCE
   Match: 78% | Quality: silver

💡 Based on your current problem, pattern #1 seems most relevant
```

### Example 2: Real-Time Analysis
```
You: cache_analyze()
Claude Cache: 📊 Current Session Analysis:

✅ Success Detected! (Confidence: high)
🎯 Confidence: high
🔍 Problem: implementing JWT refresh tokens for auth
💡 Solution: httpOnly cookie rotation with secure headers
🏆 Quality: gold
🔍 Insights: 4 detected
   • Tests passed after implementation
   • User moved to next task (implicit success)
   • No complaints after solution
📈 Signal Strength:
   • Conversation: 85%
   • Execution: 95%
   • User Intent: 80%
   • Behavior: 90%
💭 Recommendation: Definitely save this pattern - high quality solution
```

### Example 3: Smart Auto-Save
```
[After Claude implements JWT refresh tokens and tests pass]

You: Perfect! That worked great. Now let me work on the user profile page.
Claude Cache: ✅ Auto-saved successful pattern!
This JWT refresh implementation will help next time you face auth issues.

[Pattern automatically saved with gold quality rating]
```

## 🚀 Why v0.9.0 Is Revolutionary

1. **🧠 True Intelligence** - Understands conversation flow, not just keywords
2. **⚡ Zero Interruption** - Auto-saves patterns when you're clearly successful
3. **🎯 Behavioral Understanding** - Recognizes implicit success signals
4. **📊 Multi-Signal Fusion** - Combines conversation, execution, intent, and behavior
5. **🔄 Real-Time Learning** - Continuous analysis of your coding sessions
6. **🎪 Context Awareness** - Knows if you're exploring vs implementing
7. **🚀 Proactive Intelligence** - Suggests before you even ask

## 📊 Performance

- Query time: <100ms for 10,000 patterns
- Semantic search: 2x better accuracy than keyword
- Auto-indexing: Real-time as you work
- Memory efficient: SQLite + optional embeddings

## 🔍 Debugging

If MCP tools don't appear:

1. Check Claude Code logs:
```bash
claude-code --mcp-debug
```

2. Test MCP server directly:
```bash
cache-mcp
# Should start without errors
```

3. Verify config:
```bash
cat .claude.json
# Should show mcpServers configuration
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Learn Often** - Use `/mcp__cache__learn` when things work
2. **Query First** - Check patterns before implementing
3. **Be Specific** - Better queries = better results
4. **Use Categories** - Organize patterns by type
5. **Project Separation** - Keep project patterns separate
