## Solo Developer Scenarios

### 🎯 The Authentication Loop Problem

**Situation**: You're building a React app with JWT authentication.

**Monday - First Encounter**:
```javascript
// Spent 2 hours debugging infinite redirect loop
// Tried: localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies
// Finally solved with useEffect cleanup
```

**Claude Cache Captures**:
- 🚫 **Anti-pattern**: "localStorage for auth tokens (XSS vulnerable)"
- 🚫 **Anti-pattern**: "Missing useEffect cleanup causes loops"
- ✅ **Success pattern**: "useEffect with cleanup for auth state"
- 🗺️ **Journey**: "localStorage → sessionStorage → cookies → useEffect cleanup"

**Friday - Same Issue in Different Project**:
```bash
/mcp__cache__query "auth redirect loop"
```

**Claude Cache Returns**:
```
🗺️ Journey Pattern (Your Experience):
   "Auth loop: localStorage ❌ → cookies ❌ → useEffect cleanup ✅"
   Time to solution last time: 2 hours
   Skip to: useEffect cleanup pattern

⚠️ Anti-Pattern Warning:
   "Don't use localStorage for auth (XSS risk)"
   Failed in: [YourApp, ClientProject, SideProject]

✅ Gold Pattern:
   "useEffect cleanup prevents auth redirect loops"
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     let mounted = true;
     checkAuth().then(user => {
       if (mounted) setUser(user);
     });
     return () => { mounted = false; };
   }, []);
   ```
```

**Time Saved**: 2 hours → 2 minutes

### 🎯 The Database Performance Crisis

**Situation**: Your Node.js app is running slowly in production.

**Initial Attempts (Captured by Claude Cache)**:
1. ❌ Increased server RAM (no effect)
2. ❌ Added Redis caching (marginal improvement)
3. ❌ Optimized frontend bundles (not the issue)
4. ✅ Added database indexes (90% improvement!)

**Next Project with Similar Issue**:
```bash
/mcp__cache__suggest
context: "Slow API responses with PostgreSQL"
```

**Claude Cache Suggests**:
```
Based on your journey pattern from LastProject:

🗺️ Skip These (Didn't Work):
- Server resources (tried, no effect)
- Redis caching (marginal gains)
- Frontend optimization (wrong layer)

✅ Go Straight To:
- Check missing database indexes
- Analyze query execution plans
- Consider connection pooling

📊 Your Success Rate:
- Database indexing: 90% improvement in 3 projects
- Connection pooling: 60% improvement in 2 projects
```

## Team Development

### 🎯 Shared Learning Across Team

**Scenario**: Senior developer solves complex WebSocket issue.

**Senior Dev's Solution**:
```javascript
// After 3 hours of debugging WebSocket disconnections
"Perfect! The issue was the heartbeat interval competing with nginx timeout"
```

**Claude Cache Captures**:
```
🏆 Gold Pattern: "WebSocket heartbeat must be < nginx timeout"
Context: "Prevents unexpected disconnections"
Projects: [ChatApp, RealtimeDashboard]
Confidence: 95%
```

**Junior Dev Hits Similar Issue**:
```bash
/mcp__cache__query "websocket keeps disconnecting"
```

**Gets Senior's Solution Immediately**:
```
✅ Team Pattern (by SeniorDev):
"WebSocket heartbeat interval must be less than nginx proxy_read_timeout"

Configuration needed:
- Client: heartbeat every 25s
- Nginx: proxy_read_timeout 30s
- Server: pong timeout 35s

Reasoning: "Prevents nginx from closing idle connections"
Solved in: ChatApp, RealtimeDashboard
```

### 🎯 Preventing Team-Wide Mistakes

**Scenario**: One developer discovers a critical security issue.

**Discovery**:
```javascript
// Developer finds XSS vulnerability in markdown rendering
"This is a major security issue - markdown-it without DOMPurify allows XSS!"
```

**Claude Cache Captures Anti-Pattern**:
```
🚫 CRITICAL Anti-Pattern: "markdown-it without sanitization"
Security Risk: XSS attacks possible
Failed in: BlogApp (security audit failed)
Alternative: Always use with DOMPurify
```

**Prevents Future Issues Team-Wide**:
```bash
# Any team member working on markdown
/mcp__cache__query "markdown rendering"

Returns:
⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:
"Never use markdown-it without DOMPurify sanitization"
Last incident: BlogApp security audit
```

## Learning from Failures

### 🎯 The State Management Evolution

**Project Timeline (All Captured)**:

**Week 1 - Redux Attempt**:
```javascript
// Tried Redux for simple todo app
"This is way too complex for our needs"
```
- 🚫 Anti-pattern: "Redux overkill for simple state"

**Week 2 - Context API Attempt**:
```javascript
// Switched to Context API
"Performance issues with frequent updates"
```
- ⚠️ Caution: "Context API causes unnecessary re-renders"

**Week 3 - Zustand Success**:
```javascript
// Finally tried Zustand
"Perfect! Simple and performant!"
```
- ✅ Gold: "Zustand for medium complexity state"

**Future Projects Get Complete Picture**:
```bash
/mcp__cache__query "state management react"
```

**Returns Journey**:
```
🗺️ Complete Journey (Your Experience):

For Simple State (< 10 values):
❌ Redux - Overkill, too much boilerplate
❌ MobX - Unnecessary complexity
✅ useState + useContext - Just right

For Medium Complexity:
❌ Redux - Still too heavy
⚠️ Context API - Re-render issues
✅ Zustand - Perfect balance

For Complex Apps:
⚠️ Zustand - Might lack features
✅ Redux Toolkit - Worth the complexity
✅ Valtio - Good alternative
```

### 🎯 The Testing Strategy Journey

**Evolution Captured Over Time**:

1. **Started with**: No tests
   - 🚫 Result: "Bugs in production, afraid to refactor"

2. **Overcorrected**: 100% coverage mandate
   - 🚫 Result: "Slow development, brittle tests"

3. **Found Balance**: Critical path + integration tests
   - ✅ Result: "Fast development, confidence in deploys"

**New Project Guidance**:
```bash
/mcp__cache__suggest
context: "Setting up testing for new React app"
```

**Returns Your Learned Balance**:
```
Based on your testing journey:

Skip These Extremes (You Tried):
❌ No tests - Led to production bugs
❌ 100% coverage - Slowed development

Your Optimal Strategy (Proven):
✅ Integration tests for critical paths (auth, payments)
✅ Unit tests for complex logic only
✅ E2E for happy paths only
⚠️ Skip testing UI details

Tools That Worked for You:
- Vitest (fast, worked every time)
- React Testing Library (better than Enzyme)
- Playwright (stable E2E)
```

## Journey Pattern Examples

### 🎯 The CORS Resolution Journey

**Complete Problem → Solution Path**:

```
Initial Error: "CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'"

Journey Captured by Claude Cache:

Attempt 1 (10 min):
❌ Added Access-Control headers to frontend
Why Failed: "Headers must be on server response"

Attempt 2 (20 min):
❌ Used wildcard origin (*)
Why Failed: "Doesn't work with credentials"

Attempt 3 (15 min):
❌ Tried proxy in package.json
Why Failed: "Only works in development"

Attempt 4 (5 min):
✅ Configured express cors middleware properly
Solution: cors({ origin: process.env.CLIENT_URL, credentials: true })

Total Time: 50 minutes
Key Insight: "CORS is a server concern, not client"
```

**Next Time You Hit CORS**:
```bash
/mcp__cache__query "CORS"
```

**Get the Complete Journey**:
```
🗺️ Your CORS Resolution Path:
Skip attempts 1-3 (45 min saved)
Go directly to: Server-side CORS middleware

Quick Fix:
npm install cors
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.CLIENT_URL,
  credentials: true
}))

Why this works: Server controls CORS, not client
```

### 🎯 The Memory Leak Hunt

**Debugging Journey Captured**:

```
Problem: "React app memory usage growing"

Your Debugging Path:

Hour 1:
❌ Checked for large arrays/objects
❌ Reduced image sizes
❌ Implemented lazy loading

Hour 2:
❌ Added React.memo everywhere
❌ Virtualized lists
⚠️ Slight improvement but leak continues

Hour 3:
✅ Found the culprit: Event listeners in useEffect without cleanup

Pattern Learned:
"Memory leaks usually from:
1. Event listeners without cleanup (60% of cases)
2. Timers without clearTimeout (25% of cases)
3. Subscriptions without unsubscribe (15% of cases)"
```

## Cross-Project Intelligence

### 🎯 Pattern Recognition Across Projects

**Claude Cache Identifies Recurring Patterns**:

```
Pattern: "API Error Handling"

Seen in Your Projects:
- E-commerce App: Implemented toast notifications
- Dashboard: Used inline error messages
- Mobile App: Created error boundary

Confidence Ranking:
🏆 Toast notifications (worked in 3 projects, 95% satisfaction)
🥈 Error boundaries (worked in 2 projects, 85% satisfaction)
🥉 Inline messages (worked but users missed them)

Suggested Approach:
"Use toast for transient errors, boundaries for fatal errors"
```

### 🎯 Technology Migration Patterns

**From Your Project History**:

```
Migration: JavaScript → TypeScript

Your Successful Pattern (3 projects):
1. Start with tsconfig.json in JS-compatible mode
2. Rename files gradually (.js → .ts)
3. Add types file-by-file
4. Tighten tsconfig after full migration

Your Failed Attempts:
❌ Big bang migration (too many errors)
❌ Strict mode from start (team frustration)

Time Estimates (from your data):
- Small project: 1 week
- Medium project: 3 weeks
- Large project: 2 months
```

## Debugging Scenarios

### 🎯 The Production-Only Bug

**Captured Debugging Session**:

```
Bug: "Works locally, fails in production"

Your Investigation Path:
1. ❌ Check environment variables (all present)
2. ❌ Compare Node versions (same)
3. ❌ Check build output (looks normal)
4. ✅ Found it: Case-sensitive file imports on Linux

Learning: "macOS is case-insensitive, Linux isn't"
Projects Affected: [AppOne, ClientProject, APIServer]
```

**Prevents Future Issues**:
```bash
# Working on new project
/mcp__cache__suggest
context: "Deploying Node app to Linux server"

Returns:
⚠️ Common Production Issues You've Hit:
1. File imports must match case exactly
2. NODE_ENV must be set to 'production'
3. Build before deploy (you forgot twice)
4. Database URLs differ (localhost vs container)
```

## Performance Optimization

### 🎯 React Performance Journey

**Your Optimization Evolution**:

```
App: Dashboard with 50+ components

Optimization Journey:

Phase 1 (Small Gains):
- React.memo on everything (+5% improvement)

## Security Patterns

### 🎯 Authentication Security Evolution

**Your Security Learning Path**:

```
Project 1: Basic Auth
🚫 Stored passwords in plain text
💥 Learned: "Never store plain passwords"

Project 2: Better Auth
🚫 Used MD5 hashing
💥 Learned: "MD5 is broken, use bcrypt"

Project 3: Good Auth
✅ bcrypt with salt rounds
⚠️ Stored JWT in localStorage
💥 Learned: "XSS can steal localStorage"

Project 4: Secure Auth
✅ bcrypt with appropriate rounds
✅ httpOnly cookies for JWT
✅ CSRF protection added
✅ Rate limiting on login

Current Best Practice (from your experience):
- bcrypt with 10+ rounds
- JWT in httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies
- Refresh token rotation
- Rate limiting on all auth endpoints
```

## Framework Migration

### 🎯 Create React App → Vite Migration

**Your Successful Migration Pattern**:

```
Captured from 3 migrations:

Week 1 Planning:
✅ Set up Vite config alongside CRA
✅ Test build with small portion

Week 2 Migration:
✅ Move src/ files as-is
✅ Update import aliases
✅ Replace process.env with import.meta.env

Week 3 Optimization:
✅ Remove CRA dependencies
✅ Optimize Vite config
✅ Update CI/CD pipelines

Common Issues You Solved:
- SVG imports need ?react suffix
- Environment variables need VITE_ prefix
- Jest → Vitest test migration

Time Saved on 3rd Migration:
First: 3 weeks
Second: 1 week
Third: 3 days (using Claude Cache patterns)
```

## Documentation as Knowledge

### 🎯 Building a Component Library

**Your Documentation Pattern Evolution**:

```
Attempt 1: No documentation
Result: "Team couldn't use components correctly"

Attempt 2: Extensive README
Result: "Nobody read it"

Attempt 3: Storybook with examples
Result: "Perfect! Interactive and searchable"

Captured Pattern:
✅ Component documentation that works:
1. Props table with TypeScript types
2. Live Storybook examples
3. Common use cases
4. Dos and Don'ts section

Applied to 5 projects successfully
```

### 🎯 API Documentation Pattern

**Your Successful Approach**:

```bash
/mcp__cache__browse "https://stripe.com/docs/api"
# Indexed Stripe patterns

/mcp__cache__query "payment integration"
# Returns YOUR Stripe implementation + Stripe's docs
```

**Result**: Combined official docs with your implementation patterns
