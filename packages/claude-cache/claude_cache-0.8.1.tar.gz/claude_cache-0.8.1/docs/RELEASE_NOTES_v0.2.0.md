# v0.2.0 - Intelligent Documentation Import & Hierarchical Organization

## 🎉 Major Release Highlights

This release transforms the first-run experience and massively improves scalability with intelligent documentation organization.

## ✨ What's New

### 🚀 First-Run Documentation Import
- **Automatic prompt on first launch** to scan your Development folder
- **Batch import** all existing documentation from multiple projects at once
- **Immediate knowledge base** - Start with hundreds of lessons instead of zero!
- **Interactive menu** - Choose to scan Development folder, custom directory, or skip

### 📚 Intelligent Lesson Organization
- **Automatic categorization** by topic (authentication, database, API, debugging, etc.)
- **Priority levels** - Critical, High, Medium, Low with visual indicators
- **Smart overflow handling** - Automatically creates multi-part files for large categories
- **Navigation links** between related lesson files

### 🏗️ Hierarchical Documentation System
- **Lightweight CLAUDE.md** (5-10KB) acts as an intelligent index
- **Category-specific files** in `.claude/lessons/` for unlimited content
- **Smart references** - Claude knows exactly where to find specific topics
- **User content preservation** - Your custom notes are never overwritten

### 🔍 New CLI Commands
```bash
# Scan repository for documentation
cache scan-docs /path/to/repo

# Search through imported documentation
cache search-docs --query "authentication"
```

## 📊 Technical Improvements

- **New modules**: `doc_scanner.py` and `lesson_organizer.py`
- **Enhanced knowledge base** with documentation storage
- **Optimized context size** - Main file stays under 30KB
- **Scalable to thousands of lessons** without performance impact
- **Configurable limits** - 10 lessons per priority, 40 per file

## 🎯 User Experience
