    Set a nested value inside a mapping-only structure.

    The function always deep-copies the input `data` to ensure the original
    object remains unchanged. A new root object is returned in all cases.

    Behavior:
        - If `route` is falsy (None or empty), the entire root is replaced
          with a deep copy of `value`.
        - If the copied root is `None` (e.g., from an empty YAML file),
          it is bootstrapped as an empty dict `{}`.
        - For each parent segment in the route:
            * If the key is missing: a new dict is created at that key.
            * If the key exists but its value is not a mapping:
                - Raise `TypeError` (default), OR
                - If `overwrite_conflicts=True`, replace the value with `{}`.
        - At the final segment, `value` is assigned to the key.

    Args:
        data (Data):
            The original root object (may be None, dict, or other Data).
            This object is deep-copied before modification.
        route (Optional[Route]):
            A `Route` of hashable keys specifying where to set the value.
            If None or empty, the root itself is replaced.
        value (Optional[Any]):
            The value to assign at the target route.
        overwrite_conflicts (bool, default=False):
            Whether to overwrite non-mapping values encountered on the path.

            - True: destructively replace the conflicting value with `{}`.
