```note
Detect the license for the source code.
Use Source Code Scanner and process the scanner results.
```

**FOSSLight Source Scanner** uses source code scanners, [ScanCode][sc] and [SCANOSS][scanoss]. [ScanCode][sc] detects copyright and license phrases contained in the file and [SCANOSS][scanoss] searches OSS Name, OSS Version, download location, copyright and license information from [OSSKB][osskb]. Some files (ex- build script), binary files, directory and files in specific directories (ex-test) are excluded from the result. And removes words such as "-only" and "-old-style" from the license name to be printed. The output result is generated in spreadsheet format.
