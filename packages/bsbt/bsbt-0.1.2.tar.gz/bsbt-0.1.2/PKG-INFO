# ðŸ§¬ BSBT â€“ Antibody to Antigen Prediction

BSBT (Biological Sequence Binding Tool) is a Python package designed to **predict antigen sequences given antibody sequences**.  
The package is structured to allow easy experimentation and integration of **protein language models (PLMs)** or **large language models (LLMs)** in the future.

At the moment, BSBT provides a **mock implementation** using hardcoded antibodyâ€“antigen sequence mappings. This enables developers and researchers to test the pipeline structure before connecting it to real machine learning models.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ”¹ Simple **antibody â†’ antigen prediction** interface (`findAntigen`)
- ðŸ”¹ Current backend: **mock hardcoded mappings**
- ðŸ”¹ Future backend: **LLM or fine-tuned PLM integration**
- ðŸ”¹ Modular design (easy to extend, swap components)
- ðŸ”¹ Unit tests included (`pytest`-ready)
