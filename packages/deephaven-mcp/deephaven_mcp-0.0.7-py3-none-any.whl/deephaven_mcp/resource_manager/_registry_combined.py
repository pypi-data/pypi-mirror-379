"""
Combined registry for managing both community and enterprise session resources.

This module provides the `CombinedSessionRegistry` class that unifies management of both
community sessions and multiple enterprise (CorePlus) session factory registries
with proper async locking, caching, and lifecycle management.

Key Classes:
    CombinedSessionRegistry: Unified registry managing community sessions and
        enterprise session factories with their associated controller clients.

Features:
    - Unified API for accessing both community and enterprise sessions
    - Thread-safe operations with asyncio locking for concurrent access
    - Automatic caching and lifecycle management of controller clients
    - Smart controller client recreation if connections die
    - Efficient session tracking with separate storage for different registry types
    - Enterprise session discovery via controller clients
    - Graceful error handling and resource cleanup

Architecture:
    The combined registry maintains:
    - A single CommunitySessionRegistry for community sessions
    - A CorePlusSessionFactoryRegistry for enterprise session factories
    - A cache of controller clients for enterprise registries
    - A unified sessions dictionary tracking all available sessions across both types

Usage:
    Create a CombinedSessionRegistry, initialize it with a ConfigManager, and use it
    to access and manage all session resources. The registry handles all the complexities
    of maintaining separate registry types while presenting a unified interface:

    ```python
    registry = CombinedSessionRegistry()
    await registry.initialize(config_manager)
    sessions = await registry.get_all()  # Gets all sessions across community and enterprise
    await registry.close()  # Properly closes all resources and manages resource cleanup
    ```

    A unified registry for managing both community and enterprise session resources.

    This registry provides a centralized management system for all session resources,
    including both community (local) sessions and enterprise (CorePlus) sessions across
    multiple factories. It manages the full lifecycle of these resources with proper
    caching, health checking, and cleanup.

    Architecture:
        - A single CommunitySessionRegistry for local community sessions
        - A CorePlusSessionFactoryRegistry for enterprise session factories
        - A cache of controller clients for efficient enterprise session management
        - A unified sessions dictionary tracking all available sessions
        - Intelligent enterprise session discovery via controller clients

    Key Features:
        - Unified API for managing heterogeneous session resources
        - Controller client health monitoring and management
        - Efficient session resource reuse and cleanup
        - Thread-safe operations with proper asyncio locking
        - Graceful error handling and resource lifecycle management
        - Support for dynamic session discovery from enterprise controllers

    Usage:
        The registry must be initialized before use and properly closed when no longer needed:
        ```python
        registry = CombinedSessionRegistry()
        await registry.initialize(config_manager)

        # Get all available sessions
        all_sessions = await registry.get_all()

        # Get a specific session
        session = await registry.get("enterprise:factory1:session1")

        # Close the registry when done
        await registry.close()
        ```

    Thread Safety:
        All methods in this class are designed to be coroutine-safe and can be
        called concurrently from multiple tasks. Internal synchronization ensures
        consistent state.

        The closure pattern used here captures the factory reference in the creation_function,
