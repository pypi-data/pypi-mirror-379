# Plotting parameters
PLOT_TSTART: 0  # float (in s) or 'None' -> starting time of the input signal is used

###################
# Threshold method: 'fixed', 'fitted'

# Fitting Parameters
# available fit functions: 'HalfGaussian', 'DoubleGaussian'
# FirstGaussian: detects main peak (DOWN), fits Gaussian to left half, set threshold to mean + sigma*SIGMA_FACTOR
# DoubleGaussian: Fits two Gaussians, threshold = central minima, or if no second peak mean1 + sigma1*SIGMA_FACTOR

# Factor to multiply with the standard deviation
# to determine threshold
