Nexla API client

## Classes

### NexlaClient

Defined in `nexla_sdk/client.py:34`

Client for the Nexla API

The Nexla API supports two authentication methods:

1. **Service Key Authentication** (recommended):
   Service keys are long-lived credentials created in the Nexla UI. The SDK
   obtains session tokens using the service key on demand and re-obtains a new
   token as needed. No refresh endpoint is used.
   
2. **Direct Access Token Authentication**:
   Use a pre-obtained access token directly. These tokens are not refreshed by the SDK.

Examples:
    # Method 1: Using service key (recommended for automation)
    client = NexlaClient(service_key="your-service-key")
    
    # Method 2: Using access token directly (manual/short-term use)
    client = NexlaClient(access_token="your-access-token")
    
    # Using the client (same regardless of authentication method)
    flows = client.flows.list()
    
Note:
    - Service keys should be treated as highly sensitive credentials
    - Only provide either service_key OR access_token, not both
    - When using direct access tokens, ensure they have sufficient lifetime
      for your operations as they cannot be automatically refreshed

Methods:

- `get_access_token(self) -> str`
  - Source: `nexla_sdk/client.py:157`
  - Get a valid access token.
- `refresh_access_token(self) -> str`
  - Source: `nexla_sdk/client.py:179`
  - Obtain a fresh token and return it.
- `request(self, method: str, path: str, **kwargs) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]`
  - Source: `nexla_sdk/client.py:230`
  - Send a request to the Nexla API
