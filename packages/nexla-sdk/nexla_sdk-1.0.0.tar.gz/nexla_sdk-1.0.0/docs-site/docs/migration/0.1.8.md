title: Migration Guide — 0.1.7 → 0.1.8
description: Changes between v0.1.7 and v0.1.8.
slug: /migration/0.1.8
---

This guide summarizes changes observed between Git tags `v0.1.7` and `v0.1.8`.

### Highlights

- **Schema templates**: `SchemasAPI` gains helpers for retrieving, creating, and deleting reusable templates (`GET/POST/DELETE /data_schemas/templates`). Client code no longer needs to hand-craft payloads before promoting schemas to templates.
- **Webhook lifecycle tooling**: `WebhooksAPI` adds `test`, `retry`, and `get_history` to exercise endpoints such as `/webhooks/{id}/test` and `/webhooks/{id}/deliveries`. New response models (`WebhookDelivery`, `WebhookDeliveryList`, `WebhookTestResult`) capture delivery metadata, status codes, and retry outcomes.
- **User lookup coverage**: Integration tests now execute `users.get_by_email`, ensuring deployments with the requisite permission set can resolve a user record directly from an email address.

### Compatibility & Impact

- No breaking interface changes were detected between v0.1.7 and v0.1.8. Existing method signatures remain compatible.
- New models introduce additional optional fields only; down-level code that ignores them continues to function.
- Webhook delivery history endpoints may generate larger payloads—consider paginating via `per_page` if you surface them in dashboards.

### Recommended Follow-up

1. Adopt the built-in schema template helpers instead of issuing raw REST calls when promoting schemas.
2. Replace custom webhook retry/test utilities with the SDK methods to inherit common error handling.
3. Verify that service keys used in automation have the `users:read` scope if you intend to call `users.get_by_email`.
