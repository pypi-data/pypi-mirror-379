**Writing technical documentation like API specs is often a burden for software engineers ‚Äî it‚Äôs not their expertise, and rarely a top priority. That‚Äôs where Zylo-docs comes in. Zylo-docs seamlessly integrates with FastAPI and automatically generates OpenAPI-compliant specs. With powerful AI assistance, it helps developers create clear, user-friendly, and rich documentation with minimal effort. Think of it as a more intuitive, AI-powered alternative to Swagger.**

## [1/10] Get Started (Add boilerplate code)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
# üëá [1/2] Add this import at the top
from zylo_docs import zylo_docs

app = FastAPI()
# üëá [2/2] Add this your entry point file (e.g., main.py)
zylo_docs(app)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}

...
...
...


```

## [2/10] Run the FastAPI Server

```python
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

You need to start the server using **Uvicorn**.

> ‚ö°Ô∏è **If your server is already running, you can skip this step.**

**Once the server is running, open your browser and go to: üëâ [http://localhost:8000/zylo-docs](http://localhost:8000/zylo-docs)** </br>
(‚ö†Ô∏è If your development server runs on a different port, update the URL accordingly!)

## [3/10] Tada! You can now view beautifully structured API specs with zylo-docs.

## [5/10] Provide context to the zylo-docs AI
Context example
```
Our pet store is called "Patricia", and the pet_id represents the registered number of the pet. This should be reflected in the API specs.
```
