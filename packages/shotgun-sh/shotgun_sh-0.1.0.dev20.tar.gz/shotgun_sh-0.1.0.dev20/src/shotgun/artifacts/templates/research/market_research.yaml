              ## Risk Assessment

              ### Market Risks

              | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
              |------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
              | Market size smaller than estimated | Medium | High | Validate with more customer research |

              | Customer adoption slower | Medium | High | Start with easier segment |
              | Regulatory changes | Low | High | Monitor, build compliance early |

              ### Assumption Testing Plan

              **Critical Assumptions to Validate**:
              
              1. **Assumption**: Customers will pay $X for Y value
                 - **Test**: Pricing page A/B test
                 - **Success Criteria**: 5% conversion at target price
                 - **Timeline**: 4 weeks

              2. **Assumption**: We can acquire customers at <$Z CAC
                 - **Test**: Limited ad campaign
                 - **Success Criteria**: <$Z cost per qualified lead
                 - **Timeline**: 6 weeks

              3. **Assumption**: Market is shifting from build to buy
                 - **Test**: Customer interview series
                 - **Success Criteria**: >60% considering purchase
                 - **Timeline**: 2 weeks

              ## Validation Milestones

              | Stage | Key Question | Evidence Required | Go/No-Go Criteria |
              |-------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
              | Month 1 | Is the pain real? | 20 customer interviews | >80% validate pain |
              | Month 3 | Will they pay? | 10 paid pilots | >50% convert |
              | Month 6 | Can we scale? | 50 customers | CAC < 0.5x ACV |
              | Month 12 | Is there a market? | $1M ARR | Growth >20% MoM |

              ## Pivot Triggers
              - If conversion <2% after 6 months â†’ Revisit pricing/packaging
              - If CAC >2x ACV after 9 months â†’ Change GTM strategy
              - If NPS <30 after 50 customers â†’ Product-market fit issue

              1. **Immediate** (This week): [Specific action]
              2. **Short-term** (This month): [Key validation]
