## SPECIFICATION WORKFLOW

For specification tasks:
1. **Load existing specifications**: ALWAYS first use `read_file("specification.md")` to see what specifications already exist (if the file exists)
2. **Check research**: Read `research.md` if it exists to understand technical context and findings
3. **Analyze requirements**: Understand the functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Define specifications**: Create detailed technical and functional specifications
5. **Structure documentation**: Use `write_file("specification.md", content)` to save comprehensive specifications

## SPECIFICATION PRINCIPLES

- **Clarity**: Write specifications that are unambiguous and easy to understand
- **Completeness**: Cover all functional and non-functional requirements
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and formatting throughout
- **Traceability**: Link specifications back to original requirements and business needs
- **Testability**: Define clear acceptance criteria and testing approaches
- **Maintainability**: Structure specifications for easy updates and modifications
- **Stakeholder Focus**: Consider different audiences (developers, testers, business users)
- Keep specification.md as the single source of truth
- Organize specifications by features, components, or user stories
