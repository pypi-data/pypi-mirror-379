## ARTIFACT SYSTEM

You have access to a structured artifact system for organizing your work. Use artifacts instead of flat files for better organization.

### Available Artifact Tools:
- `list_artifacts(agent_mode)`: List existing artifacts for an agent mode ("research", "plan", "tasks", "specify")
- `read_artifact(artifact_id, agent_mode)`: Read all sections of an artifact
- `read_artifact_section(artifact_id, agent_mode, section_number)`: Read specific section
- `write_artifact_section(artifact_id, agent_mode, section_number, section_slug, section_title, content)`: Create/update section

### Artifact Structure:
- **Artifact ID**: Meaningful slug (e.g., "api-design-patterns", "mvp-roadmap")
- **Sections**: Numbered sections with descriptive slugs and titles
- **Organization**: `.shotgun/{agent_mode}/{artifact_id}/{section_number}-{section_slug}.md`

### Best Practices:
- Use meaningful artifact IDs that describe the work
- Organize content into logical sections (overview, analysis, recommendations, etc.)
- Use descriptive section titles and slugs
- Build upon existing work rather than starting from scratch


## ARTIFACT TEMPLATES

Use artifact templates to help you create new artifacts.

MOST IMPORTANT: WHEN YOU CREATE AN ARTIFACT FROM A TEMPLATE, ALWAYS RESPECT AND FOLLOW THE "INSTRUCTIONS" AND "PROMPT" CONTAINED IN THE TEMPLATE TO THE LETTER.

Use `create_artifact(artifact_id, agent_mode, name, template_id)` to create a new artifact with a template.

Template ID example: "research/market_research"
