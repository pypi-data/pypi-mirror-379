      Specify [-C] ColumnNames, refer to Option -C section for detail
      description, and choose at least one of the condition options, -a, -c,
      -d, -D, -e, -E, -f, -g, -I, -k, -m, -M, -N, -o, -q, -s, -S -t, -T, -v, -V
      and -y, to run this application.

      For all condition options, except option -a, an '!' sign can be added
      between an option flag and its option values to get an excluding
      condition. For example, choose '-o ! OrganizationTypes' to gather order
      data usage by users from organization types other than the ones given in
      OrganizationTypes.  Refer to the example given at the end of this help
      document for how to select excluding condition.

      String condition options, -c, -e, -f, -g, -k, -M, -o, -S, -t and -v, allow
      wildcard inputs. '%' matches any number of characters and '_' matches
      any one character.  Refer to the example given at the end of this help
      document for how to use wildcard for string condition options.

      Output of this application is defaulted to page format with a page
      header on each page. A page header includes main title, sub titles and
      column titles according to which column names and options are selected,
      as well as page number and report date. If the output is used directly
      for input of other applications, add option -w to remove page header
      and show only the column titles and the usage information.


      Column Options:
      - Option -C, the ColumnNames must be present to run this application.
           The flag -C can be omitted if it is the first parameter option on
           the command line. The ColumnNames is a string that includes column

          IndexColumn:
              X - INDEX        - index of line, it should be the first column

           The column names are used to build up string of ColumnNames, while
           their associated column titles are shown in view/report output of
           this application. The display order of the column titles is
           determined by the order of the column names in the ColumnNames
           string. At least one of the group and summary columns must be
           selected, in the ColumnNames string, to generate all usage
           view/report;

           For example, choose '-C EMB' to display column titles of EMAIL,
           MONTH and MBREAD, in the first, second and third columns
           respectively, for numbers of MBytes of data read by each user
           in each month;

      - Option -O, sort data usage information in ascending or descending
           order based on the column names specified in OrderColumnNames
           string. These column names must be in the selected [-C]
           ColumnNames string. If an column name is in upper case, its
           associated column is sorted in ascending order, and a lower
           case means sorting in descending order;


      Condition Options:
      - Option -a, for all usage in table 'allusage';

      - Option -A, gives a row limit for querying; 

      - Option -c, for data read by users from given country codes;

      - Option -d, for data read on given dates, in format YYYY-MM-DD;

      - Option -D, for data read between two given dates, each date

      - Option -e, for data read by users with given email addresses;

      - Option -E, for data read by users who have been notified 
           data update of a specified dataset between two given dates,
           each date is in format YYYY-MM-DD. Omit EndNoticeDate for
           no upper limit;

      - Option -f, for data in datasets with specified data format;

      - Option -g, for data usage source groups, W - Web log, G - Globus,
           T - Thredds, O - Request Order, A - AWS log, C - CDG GDEX DB,
           and P - OSDF logs on Pelican Platform;

      - Option -h, works with Option -e to include historical user emails
           registered before;

      - Option -k, for data read by users from given region names;

      - Option -m, for data read in given months, in format YYYY-MM;

      - Option -M, for data read via given medium methods;

      - Option -N, for files for numbers of read by each group between
           MinNumberRead and MaxNumberRead. Omit MaxNumberRead for no
           upper limit;

      - Option -o, for data read by users from given orgnization types.
           It defaults to -o ! DSS to exclude usage from DSS specialists.
           Set it to ALL to include all orgnization types;

      - Option -q, for data read in given quarters;

      - Option -s, for data sizes, unit of MByte, between MinSize and MaxSize.
           Omit MaxSize for no upper limit;

      - Option -S, for login names of specialsts who own the datasets;

      - Option -t, for data associating to given dataset names;

      - Option -T, for data associating to datasets between 
           MinDataset and MaxDataset. Omit MaxDataset for no upper limit.
           For example, -T d540000 d550009, for datasets numbers d540000-d550009;

      - Option -v, array of specified IP addresses;

      - Option -V, IP address range;

      - Option -y, for data read in given years in format YYYY;


      Miscellaneous Options:
      - Option -w, view all data usage in simple format without totals;

      - Option -z, include datasets without without usage

      - Option -H, use given report title to replace the default one;

      - Option -L, use given delimiter for output, instead of defaulted spaces;

      - Option -U, show data sizes in given unit SizeUnit [BKMG].

      - Option > OutputFilename, redirect output into an output file,
           for example, ordusage.out, instead of viewing on screen directly;

      - Option | lp -d PrinterName, redirect output to printer of PrinterName.
           Replace PrinterName with lj100 to print through DSS LaserJet printer.


      For example:
      To view annual data usage in year 2005 with columns, INDEX(X),
      EMAIL(E), ORGTYPE(O), #READ(H), and MBREAD(B); ordered by ORGTYPE as
      ascending and MBREAD(B) as descending; the command line should be:

         viewallusage XEOHB -y 2005 -O Ob

      For usage by users in all grganization types, out of the file usage
      gathered above, the command line should be:

         viewallusage XEOHB -y 2005 -o ALL -O Ob

      To redirect the previous output to a file named ordusage.out:

         viewallusage XEOHB -y 2005 -o ALL -O Ob > ordusage.out

      Then you can view the file or print it as a report.
