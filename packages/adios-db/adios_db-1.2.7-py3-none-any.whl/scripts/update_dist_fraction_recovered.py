script to set fraction recovered to 100% for distillate fuels
and oils with a method that is known to give 100%

Methods:

ASTM D86: The test method is designed for the analysis of
          distillate fuels; it is not applicable to products
          containing appreciable quantities of residual material.

            NOT set to 100%

ASTM D7169: Standard Test Method for Boiling Point Distribution
            of Samples with Residues Such as Crude Oils

            Set to 100%

ASTM D6730: This test method covers the determination of individual
            hydrocarbon components of spark-ignition engine fuels
            and their mixtures containing oxygenate blends
            (MTBE, ETBE, ethanol, and so forth) with boiling ranges up to 225Â°C

            Not set to 100% (unless combined with ASTM D7169)

ASTM D2887: Boiling range distributions obtained by this test method are essentially
            equivalent to those obtained by true boiling point (TBP) distillation.

            Set to 100%

ESTS 5.10/x.x/M: don't know what to do with this -- will send not to ESTS.
