Scripts for working with the data
#################################

A number of top-level scripts are installed along with the Python package. If the package is installed into a Python installation that is set up correctly, you should be able to invoke the scripts directly, e.g. ::

  adios_db_validate dir_to_validate

The scripts all begin with `adios_db_` -- if you have command-line completion, you should be able to see them all with a <tab><tab>

The Installed scripts
=====================

Scripts for working with the JSON files
---------------------------------------

adios_db_validate
.................

This generates validation reports from all the JSON files in the provided directory.
You must provide a directory to validate, and it will search in that dir, and any child dirs for .JSON files to validate.

Example::

    adios_db_validate oil/EC


adios_db_process_json
.....................

This processes a set of JSON files in the provided directory.
It will load them into a adios_db `Oil` object and save it out again as JSON.
This serves to make sure the JSON is valid, and normalizes the JSON with the same white space and data order, so that files with non-meaningful changes will compare equal.

You must provide a directory to process, and it will search in that dir, and any child dirs for .JSON files to process.

Example::

    adios_db_process_json noaa_oil_data/data/oil

will process all the records in the noaa_oil_data repository.

NOTE: this should always be run before merging any new or edited data into the repository.

Optionally, "dry_run" can be passed on the command line to make sure the JSON is all valid, but without making any changes to the data.

adios_db_read_noaa_csv
......................

Reads a "NOAA standard CSV file" and generates an adios_db JSON file from the data. ::

    adios_db_read_noaa_csv name_of_the_file.csv

NOAA standard CSV files are ones that conform to the NOAA Excel template format:

:download:`ADIOS data template <../../../data/ADIOS_data_template.xlsx>`

If the file will not load, and the error is not obvious, you can pass the ``--debug`` flag, and you will get a **lot** or additional information about what the script is trying to do.


adios_db_assign_ids
...................

Assign IDs to a set of new records. ::

    adios_db_assign_ids PREFIX [dry_run] data_dir, file1, file2, file3, ...

``PREFIX`` is the 2-letter prefix you want to useL, e.g. AD. It can be a new prefix, or an existing one.

``data_dir`` is a directory with the existing data -- it will be scanned to determine which IDs are already in use, so new non-conflicting ones will be generated.

You can pass in one or more JSON files, e.g. ``*.json``

If ``dry_run`` is on the command line, it will report what it would do,
but not save any changes


adios_db_add_labels
...................

This script will add likely labels to the records, based on a set of criteria developed in the code -- it will not correctly label everything, but should give you a good start.

::

  adios_db_add_labels data_dir [dry_run]

``data_dir`` is the dir where the data are: the script will recursively search for JSON files

If ``replace`` is on the command line, existing labels with be replaced.
Other wise, new ones will be added, but none removed.

If ``dry_run`` is on the command line, it will report what it would do, but not save any changes


Scripts for working with the code / tests
-----------------------------------------

adios_db_update_test_data
.........................

This will update the test data with the latest version from NOAA oil data. This should only be run by people working on the ``adios_db`` codebase.

Scripts for working with the web application / Mongo DB:
--------------------------------------------------------

These are assorted scripts that help you work with the data in a Mongo Database. This is used as the back-end for the NOAA web application. It is unlikely that you'd need these unless you are running your own version of the ADIOS\ :sup:`Â®` Oil Database web app, or another system in which you need high performance access to the data.

adios_db_init
.............

Command line utility for initializing the Mongo database -- only needed if you want to run the API (or use Mongo for something else).

.. code-block::

    $ adios_db_init --help
    usage: oil_db_init [-h] [--config CONFIG]

    Database Initialization Arguments:

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help       show this help message and exit
      --config CONFIG  Specify a *.ini file to supply application settings. If not
                       specified, the default is to use a local MongoDB server.


adios_db_import
...............

This is a command-line application that imports a number of oil record
data sets into the database. You probably have no reason ever to run this.
If you want the standard NOAA managed data, see the full set, already in
`adios_db` compatible format at:

https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD/noaa-oil-data

.. code-block::

    $ adios_db_import --help
    usage: oil_db_import [-h] [--all] [--config CONFIG]

    Database Import Arguments:

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help       show this help message and exit
      --all            Import all datasets, bypassing the menus, and quit the
                       application when finished.
      --config CONFIG  Specify a *.ini file to supply application settings. If not
                       specified, the default is to use a local MongoDB server.


adios_db_oil_query
..................

Utility for querying the mongo database directly. Not well documented.

For the most part, you can simply loop through the JSON files to find stuff, unless you really need performance (as we do in the Web App).

See the examples in the scripts dir in the repo for working directly with a set of JSON files.


adios_db_backup
...............

Utility for "backing up" the data in the Mongo Database to JSON files on disk.


adios_db_restore
................

Utility for "restoring" the Mongo Database from JSON files on disk
