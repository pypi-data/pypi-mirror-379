        Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
        does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
        Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
        other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
        information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
        warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their

        fullest extent possible.
        
        Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
        
        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
        conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
        original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
        and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        
             Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
             intended for use by those authorized to give the public
             permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
             copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
             irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
             and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
             Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
             applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
             material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
             material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
             licensed material, or material used under an exception or
             limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

             Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
             licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
             licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
             the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
             example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
             copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
             licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
             other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
             the licensed material may still be restricted for other
             reasons, including because others have copyright or other
             rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
             such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
             Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
             respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
             for the public:

             available to the public including in ways that members of the
             public may access the material from a place and at a time

          m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright

             as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
             equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
        
          n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
             under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
        
        
        Section 2 -- Scope.
        
          a. License grant.
        
               1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        
                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                       in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
        
                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
                       NonCommercial purposes only.
        
               2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                  its terms and conditions.
        
               3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                  6(a).
        
               4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                  (4) never produces Adapted Material.
        
               5. Downstream recipients.
        
                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                       recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                       receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                       Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                       Public License.
        
                    b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                       Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                       automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                       under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
        
                    c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                       any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                       apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                       Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                       Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                       Material.
        
               6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        
          b. Other rights.
        
               1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                  Rights, but not otherwise.
        
               2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                  Public License.
        
               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                  reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
                  the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
                  purposes.
        
        
        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
        following conditions.

                            Material and any others designated to receive
                            attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                            the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                            designated);
        
                        ii. a copyright notice;
        
                       iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        
                        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                            warranties;
        
                         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                            extent reasonably practicable;
        
                    b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                       retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        
                    c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this

               2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                  reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                  which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                  reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                  hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                  information.
               3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                  information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                  reasonably practicable.
        
          b. ShareAlike.
        
             In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
             Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
        
               1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
                  license with the same License Elements, this version or

               2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
                  Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
                  in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
                  context in which You Share Adapted Material.
        
               3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
                  or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
                  Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
                  rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.

             contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
             including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

             ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
             TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,

             ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR

# RTIS Dev
This project is a Python Module to be used on an embedded platform connected to a RTIS sensor. It can be used for quick prototyping and developing
Python scripts related to the sensor data from RTIS sensors. It includes functions to measure and process sonar data. 

## Installation

### Dependencies
Version numbers are those used during this project, higher versions likely supported too unless otherwise specified. 
* Python 3.6 or higher with modules:
  * Numpy
  * Scipy
  * multiprocessing-logging
  * uuid
  * RTIS Serial on Linux systems (see [here](https://cosysgit.uantwerpen.be/rtis-software/rtisserial "RTIS Serial Git repository")) 
  * PySerial on Windows systems
  * RTIS CUDA 2.6.0 or higher if any processing is desired (see [here](https://cosysgit.uantwerpen.be/rtis-software/rtiscuda "RTIS CUDA Git repository"))

### Install from PyPI
You can install this module from the [PyPi repository](https://pypi.org/project/rtisdev/) like any other:
```bash
pip install rtisdev
```

### Install from source

#### A. Automatic installation using RTIS Update
To build and install RTIS Dev and keep it automatically up to date, please use the [RTIS Update](https://cosysgit.uantwerpen.be/rtis-software/rtisupdate) script.

#### B. Manual Installation
Install all dependencies listed above. We suggest to always use pip.
```bash
pip install MODULE_NAME
```

To install the Python Module so that you can use it in any Python script on Windows:
```bash
py -m pip install .
```

And on Linux:
```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

All methods and classes are fully documented on the [wiki page](https://cosysgit.uantwerpen.be/rtis-software/rtisdev/-/wikis/home).
which has more information and examples.

#### 1) Import

If `rtisdev` is installed you can now import it in any Python script on the system as any other module:
```python
import rtisdev
```

Do note that due to RTIS Dev using [RTIS CUDA](https://cosysgit.uantwerpen.be/rtis-software/rtiscuda "RTIS CUDA Git repository"), you will need to add the folder where you installed RTIS CUDA to your library path for your script if you are using an IDEA that uses custom Python environments.
For example, using PyCharm IDE can have the issue of not being able to load RTIS CUDA library by not finding library path:
You will need to add `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with value `/usr/lib/rtiscuda` (or your custom location) manually to your run configurations. 

#### 2) General Usage

There are several classes and methods available in RTIS Dev. Some general knowledge on RTIS sonar sensors is advised.
Here is a small example that goes over most basic steps:

 ```python
import rtisdev
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Open a connection to the RTIS Device over the default serial port.
success_connect = rtisdev.open_connection(allowDebugMode=True)

# Set the recording settings with 163840 samples and a call sweep between 25 and 50 KHz.
config_uuid = rtisdev.set_recording_settings(microphoneSamples=163840, callMinimumFrequency=25000, callMaximumFrequency=50000)

# Enable all processing steps and preload them with RTIS CUDA. This will produce a 2D energyscape with 91 directions
# with a maximum distance of 6m.
success_settings_processing = rtisdev.set_processing_settings(directions=91, maxRange=6, configName=config_uuid)

# Get the used settings as a RTISSettings object.
settings = rtisdev.get_current_settings(configName=config_uuid)

# Get an ACTIVE measurement (protect your ears!) in raw data.
measurement = rtisdev.get_raw_measurement(True, configName=config_uuid)

# Store the raw data of that measurement as a binary file. This can be opened in another application for further work.
# For an example in MATLAB, see below.
raw_data_sonar = measurement.rawData.tobytes()
file_handle_data = open("test_measurement_" + str(measurement.index) + ".bin", "wb")
file_handle_data.write(raw_data_sonar)
file_handle_data.close()

# Process that raw measurement to an energyscape using the configuration chosen earlier.
processed_measurement = rtisdev.process_measurement(measurement, configName=config_uuid)

# Get a new ACTIVE measurement (protect your ears!) in both raw and processed data formats directly.
new_processed_measurement = rtisdev.get_processed_measurement(True, configName=config_uuid)

# Plot the 2D energyscape of this processed measurement.
plt.imshow(np.transpose(new_processed_measurement.processedData), cmap="hot", interpolation='nearest')
plt.xlabel("Directions (degrees)")
plt.ylabel("Range (meters)")
indexes_x = np.arange(0, new_processed_measurement.processedData.shape[0], 20)
labels_x = np.round(np.rad2deg(settings.directions[indexes_x, 0])).astype(int)
indexes_y = np.arange(0, new_processed_measurement.processedData.shape[1], 100)
labels_y = settings.ranges[indexes_y]
fmt_x = lambda x: "{:.0f}°".format(x)
fmt_y = lambda x: "{:.2f}m".format(x)
plt.xticks(indexes_x, [fmt_x(i) for i in labels_x])
plt.yticks(indexes_y, [fmt_y(i) for i in labels_y])
plt.title("RTIS Dev - 2D Energyscape Example")
ax = plt.gca()
ax.invert_yaxis()
ax.set_aspect("auto")
plt.show()

# Get a new ACTIVE measurement (protect your ears!) in both raw and microphone signal format directly.
signal_measurement = rtisdev.get_signal_measurement(True, configName=config_uuid)

# Plot the microphone signals of this measurement.
fig, axs = plt.subplots(8, 4, figsize=(10,16), constrained_layout = True)
for microphone_index_i in range(0, 8):
    for microphone_index_j in range(0, 4):
        axs[microphone_index_i, microphone_index_j].set_title(str(microphone_index_j+(microphone_index_i*4)+1))
        axs[microphone_index_i, microphone_index_j].plot(signal_measurement.processedData[microphone_index_j+(microphone_index_i*4),:])
        if microphone_index_j != 0:
            plt.setp(axs[microphone_index_i, microphone_index_j], yticklabels=[])
        if microphone_index_i != 7:
            plt.setp(axs[microphone_index_i, microphone_index_j], xticklabels=[])
        if microphone_index_i == 7:
            axs[microphone_index_i, microphone_index_j].set_xlabel("Time (Samples)")
        if microphone_index_j == 0:
            axs[microphone_index_i, microphone_index_j].set_ylabel("Amplitude")
fig.suptitle("RTIS Dev - Microphone Signals")
plt.show()
```

In the example above, a binary file is saved of the recorded measurement. This can be opened in another application for further work.
In the example below, MATLAB is used to process the raw data to microphone signals and plot these.

```matlab
% Read binary data
file_name = 'test_measurement_0.bin';
f_id = fopen(file_name, 'rb');
rawData = fread(f_id, 'uint32');
fclose(f_id);
data =  de2bi(rawData, 32);

% Generate settings for converting to microphone signals. These have to match the recording settings!
fs_pdm = 450e4; % PDM samplefrequency
fs_mic = 450e3; % Microphone samplefrequency
r_min = 0.5; % Range minimum to show
r_max = 5; % Range maximum to show

% PDM demodulation.
[b_pdm, a_pdm] = butter(6, 100e3 / ( fs_pdm / 2));
[b_bpf, a_bpf] = butter(6, [20e3 80e3] / (fs_mic / 2));
data_filtered = (filter(b_pdm, a_pdm, data));
data_filtered_dec = data_filtered(1:10:end, :);
data_mics = filter(b_bpf, a_bpf, data_filtered_dec);

% Subselect the part between the minimum and maximum range wanted.
spl_start = round(r_min * 2 / 343 * fs_mic); 
spl_stop = round(r_max * 2 / 343 * fs_mic);
data_mics = data_mics(spl_start : spl_stop, :);
data_mics = data_mics - mean(data_mics);

%% Plot the recording microphone signals
figure()
for plotcounter = 1 : 16
    subplot(4, 4, plotcounter);
    sig_out1 = data_mics(:, plotcounter) - mean(data_mics(:,plotcounter));
    plot(sig_out1 + 1);
    hold on;
    sig_out2 = data_mics(:, plotcounter + 16) - mean(data_mics(:, plotcounter + 16));
    plot(sig_out2  - 1);
    ylim([-1.5 1.5])
    hold off;
    plottitle = sprintf('Microphone %d and %d', (plotcounter * 2) - 1, plotcounter * 2);
    title(plottitle);
end 
```
