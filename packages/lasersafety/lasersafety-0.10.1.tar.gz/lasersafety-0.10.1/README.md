The goal of this project is to perform the computations related to the EN207 and EN208 standards to choose eyewear. For instance, if you have a 3 W 1550 nm laser, producing 50 picosecond pulses at a rate of 80 MHz. The accessible beam diameter is 2 mm. This library makes it as simple as 

```
lasersafety -p 3 -r 80e6 -t 50e-12 -w 1550e-9 -d 2e-3 en207

EN207 analysis

1550.0 nm D LB3
1550.0 nm M LB1
```

Meaning that we require D LB3 + M LB1 at 1550 nm.
