===========================
|Documentation| |Build Status| |PYPI Version| |Python Versions| |Python Implementations| |Python Format| |Requirements|

The official command-line client for RIPE Atlas.


Full Documentation
------------------

Everything is up on `ReadTheDocs`_

Examples
--------
Configure API key for creating measurements::

    $ ripe-atlas configure --set authorisation.create=MY_API_KEY

Ping an IP address from five probes::

    $ ripe-atlas measure ping ping.ripe.net --probes 5

.. image:: screenshots/ripe-atlas-measure-ping.png

Search for connected probes in Germany, grouping by ASN::

    $ ripe-atlas probe-search --country de --aggregate-by asn_v4 --limit 10

.. image:: screenshots/ripe-atlas-probe-search.png

Search for NTP measurement metadata and process the results with awk::

    $ ripe-atlas measurement-search --type ntp --format tab --no-header --limit 5 \
      | awk -Ft '{printf "#%s (%s)\n", $1, $3}'

Can I Contribute?
-----------------

Absolutely.  Please read our `guide`_ on how to contribute.


Colophon
--------

This project was code-named by means of a `poll`_.  In order to conform to the
RIPE Atlas theme, it had to be named for an explorer, and so the winning
suggestion was for Magellan, *"in memory of those times when RTT was ~3 years"*.
