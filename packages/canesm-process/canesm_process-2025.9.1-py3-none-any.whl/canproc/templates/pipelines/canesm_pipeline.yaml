# current problems:
# reuse variable lacks pipeline granularity

# list of pipelines that will be ran. 
# NOTES:
# Merging Pipeplines
# ------------------
# Overlap between pipelines will be removed. e.g. if both `cmip/core/core.yaml` and 
# `custom/rlr001/variability.yaml` were to contain monthly averaged `GT`, only one 
# would be ran. This is easier to administer on the backend but if they use different 
# options we should check for that and run both.
#
# Nested Pipelines
# ----------------
# Pipelines can be nested, e.g., `cmip/core/core.yaml` is simply list of more pipelines
# to run for the core CMIP diagnostics, broken down by domain.
#
# Custom Pipelines
# ----------------
# Pipelines can define their own stages and dags to be ran.
pipelines:
  - cmip/core/core.yaml
  - rtd/core.yaml
  - custom/rlr001/variability.yaml
