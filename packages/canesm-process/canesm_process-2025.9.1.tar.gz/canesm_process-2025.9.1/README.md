# CanESM Processer

A project for low level processing functionality for CanESM output. CanESM Processor aims to support the following goals:

1. Collection of basic processing elements for CanESM.
2. Support serialization of processing chains for interaction outside of python.
3. As far as is possible, decouple process logic from execution logic to support different computational environments (CPU, GPU or distributed) and storage formats (ccc, netcdf or zarr).


## Installation

```
pip install canesm-process
```
