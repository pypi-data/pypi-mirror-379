Scotty is a tool to make the process of building the SimpleCoreâ„¢ Distro distribution
reproducible on any Linux and Windows computer (compatible with WSL2). It uses a
container to setup the same environment used by our continuous integration
process to ensure that the build on your machine will always be successful for
any of our standard images. Scotty is based on standard open-source tools such as
Docker, repo, ... and mimics the standard bitbake command set (standard tool for
Yocto builds). If you are not familiar with building Yocto BSPs, we strongly
recommend that you use Scotty to start with.
