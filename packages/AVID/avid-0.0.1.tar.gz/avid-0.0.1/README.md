**AVID** is a Python framework for **declarative, data-driven processing** of large-scale image datasets, particularly designed for biomedical image analysis workflows.

## 🎯 What makes AVID special?

Unlike traditional workflow engines that require explicit DAG definitions, AVID uses a **declarative data-driven approach** where the workflow is automatically determined by the properties of your data itself. This makes it incredibly flexible and scalable - whether you're processing a single case or thousands of patients across multiple timepoints and modalities.

###  Key Features

- **🔄 Data-driven**: Workflow automatically scales based on your data structure
- **📝 Declarative**: Define what you want, not how to do it
- **🔗 Smart linking**: Automatically pairs related data (same patient, timepoint, etc.)
- **⚡ Batch processing**: Efficiently handles large cohorts
- **🔧 Extensible**: Easy to add new processing steps
- **📊 Reproducible**: Full tracking of processing steps and metadata
- **🚀 Runtime flexible**: Allows running locally, in containers, or on HPC clusters (eg. LSF, SLURM) with just configuration changes 

### 🤝 Use Cases

AVID excels in scenarios involving:
- **Multi-modal imaging studies** (CT, MR, PET, etc.)
- **Longitudinal analysis** (multiple timepoints per patient)
- **Large cohort studies** (hundreds to thousands of patients)
- **Complex processing pipelines** with many interdependent steps
- **Reproducible research** requiring full processing provenance
- **Flexible deployment**: Need to run the same workflow in different runtime environments (e.g. locally during development and on HPC clusters for production)

For more thoughts on when to use AVID and when other options might be better suited please see the section below: [When to Choose AVID vs Other Workflow Tools](#-when-to-choose-avid-vs-other-workflow-tools)


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Operating system independent (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Optional: External tools for specific processing steps


### Installation

```bash
pip install avid
```
or, if you are working with a console/terminal that supports nice rich output, we advise to install AVID with the packgage rich.
```bash
pip install avid[rich]
```


### Configuration
After you have installed AVID you can use it, but out of the box only with actions that utilize python functions
you provide (see e.g. [Basic Example](#basic-example)). In most cases the full power of AVID comes with executing other
functionality provided e.g. as command line applications or containers.

AVID will store all relevant tool information (including tools installed by AVID) in its "tool path".
Your easiest way to set everything up execute:
```bash
avidconfig setup
```
AVID supports venv. So you can also do everything just explained in a venv to isolate tools and config

A fast track to get some tools to your disposal is to let avid directly automatically download and configure the latest
version of [MITK actions](#mitk-httpswwwmitkorg). The setup wizard will also propose that. Or you can later run
```bash
avidconfig package install MITK
```

### Basic Example

```python
import avid.common.workflow as workflow
from avid.actions.pythonAction import PythonUnaryBatchAction
from avid.selectors import ValiditySelector

# Initialize session with your data
session = workflow.initSession(
    bootstrapArtefacts="path/to/your/data.avid",
    sessionPath="output/session.avid",
    name="my_analysis"
)

# Define a simple processing function
def process_image(outputs, inputs, **kwargs):
    # Your image processing logic here
    # The inputs that should be used is indicated by "inputs"
    # The location where the results should be stored are indicated by "outputs"
    pass

# Apply to all valid data
with session:
    PythonUnaryBatchAction(
        inputSelector=ValiditySelector(),
        generateCallable=process_image,
        actionTag="processed",
        defaultoutputextension="nii.gz"
    ).do()
```

## 🏗️ Core Concepts

### Data
This is the dataset which is being processed in the workflow. It contains the "raw" input data to the workflow and the output data of each processing step. The data can be located for example in a data folder or a database such as a PACS system. Each data item within the dataset has a URL pointing to where it is located.

### Artefact
Your data is represented as **artefacts** - metadata containers that describe each piece of data (images, results, etc.) with properties like patient ID, timepoint, modality, and file location.
The artefacts of a session can be written out in an xml-file. An exemplary artefact looks like this:
```xml
<avid:artefact>
    <avid:property key="case">pat1</avid:property>
    <avid:property key="timePoint">TP1</avid:property>
    <avid:property key="actionTag">CT</avid:property>
    <avid:property key="type">result</avid:property>
    <avid:property key="url">../data/img/pat1_TP1_CT.txt</avid:property>
    <avid:property key="invalid">False</avid:property>
    <avid:property key="id">bbe232b8-5740-11ec-85a6-e9d058c65a83</avid:property>
    <avid:property key="timestamp">1638869608.3330662</avid:property>
</avid:artefact>
```

### Session
The session is a set of artefacts that should be processed by a workflow. It can be seen as a "blackboard" which contains all the relevant metadata about the *data* in the form of *artefacts*. It can be read from and written to by the *actions*. The user can directly feed information about the initial input data to the session in the form of an xml file. It is also possible to gain insights into the current session by writing out the artefacts as items of an xml-file.


### Datacrawler Script
**Datacrawler scripts** are one of two types of scripts that AVID users create. Datacrawler scripts define how to discover and index your raw data. They crawl through your data folders, extract metadata from file (content, names or locations), transform it into artefacts, and create the initial session file with bootstrap artefacts.
An examplary simple crawling script could look like this:
```python
from avid.common.artefact.crawler import runCrawlerScriptMain, crawl_property_by_path
import avid.common.artefact.defaultProps as ArtefactProps
from pathlib import Path

@crawl_property_by_path(property_map={0: ArtefactProps.CASE,
                                      1: ArtefactProps.TIMEPOINT
                                      })
def fileFunction(full_path, filename, artefact_candidate, **kwargs):
    artefact_candidate[ArtefactProps.ACTIONTAG] = Path(filename).stem
    artefact_candidate[ArtefactProps.URL] = full_path
    return artefact_candidate

if __name__ == "__main__":
    runCrawlerScriptMain(fileFunction) #pre defined main function for most of the crawling needs.
```
This crawling scrip assumes that the names of the first sub dir level encodes the case ID and the second level names of
the files encodes the time point. The action tag is the stem of the filename.

This crawler script can then be executed in a shell like:
```bash
# datacrawler.py - discovers your data and creates bootstrap session (bootstrap.avid)
# with all discovered data items and their properties
python my_datacrawler.py --root /path/to/data/ --output output/bootstrap.avid
```


### Action
**Actions** are processing steps that transform your data. AVID provides many built-in actions for common image processing tasks, and you can easily create custom ones.
Each action will earmark artefacts produced by it with an artefact property called "actionTag". The value of action tag is specified in the workflow script.
E.g. in the [Basic Example](#basic-example) the action tag for the action is "processed". Therefore all outputs produced by the action can be selected via the action tag
```python
[...]
with session:
    PythonUnaryBatchAction(
        inputSelector=ValiditySelector(),
        generateCallable=process_image,
        actionTag="processed",
        defaultoutputextension="nii.gz"
    ).do()
[...]
```


### Selector
**Selectors** choose which data to process based on properties:
Data is not explicitly handed to actions. Instead, *selectors* are used to specify which artefacts should be used as input to an action. This way, instead of using all currently available artefacts from the session we can declare only a selection.
A selector selects artefacts based on properties. All available built-in selectors are located in the folder `.\avid\selectors`.

```python
# Process only MR images (which are indicated by the action tag 'MR')
selector = ActionTagSelector('MR')
```


### Linker
**Linkers** intelligently pair related data. This is needed as actions can also be given more than a single input, meaning they don't have to work on individual artefacts, but can also work on pairs of artefacts (or even more).
For example we could wish to perform a registration of MR and CT images, which takes both images as input. We can use a selector to select the desired images, but there is a problem. How do we clarify which artefacts belong together in a pair? Theoretically, each MR image could be paired with each CT image, across patients and time points. To get exactly what we want, we use *linkers*.
All available linkers are located in the folder `. \avid\linkers`.

```python
# Link MR and CT images from the same patient and timepoint
patient_linker = CaseLinker() + TimePointLinker()
```


### Splitter & Sorter
There also exist **Splitters** and **Sorters** to offer even more possibilities to steer the behavior of actions. But for most simple workflows the defaults are just fine.
Therefore we ignore them for now. If you are interested to learn more please go to the respective tutorials and in depth documentation.


### Workflow Script
**Workflow scripts** declare what processing you want to happen with your data. They define the sequence of actions, selectors, and linkers etc. that transform your data.
The script shown in [Basic Example](#basic-example) is a very simple workflow script example.

### 📁 Typical project structure
A typical AVID project structure would be for example the following:
```
your_project/
├── data/                   # The raw input data used for the project
├── output/                 # Processing results
│   ├── bootstrap.avid      # Initial bootstrap session generated data by datacrawler.py
│   ├── session/            # Session sub dir containing all results produced by workflow.py
│   └── session.avid        # Full processing session generated/used when running workflow.py
├── datacrawler.py          # Datacrawler script that is used to generates bootstrap.avid
└── workflow.py             # Main processing workflow that updates session.py and generates content of session/
```


## 📊 Real-world Example

Let's say you have a dataset with CT images, masks segmented on the CT images and  MR images from multiple patients across different timepoints, and you want to:
1. Register all MR images to the CT of the same patient/timestep
2. Calculate radiomics features for the MR images mapped to CT space using the respective masks
3. Only process complete patient datasets

```python
import avid.common.workflow as workflow
from avid.selectors import ActionTagSelector
from avid.linkers import CaseLinker, TimePointLinker
from avid.actions.mitk.MitkMatchImage import MitkMatchImageBatchAction
from avid.actions.mitk.MitkMapImage import MitkMapImageBatchAction
from avid.actions.mitk.MitkCLGlobalImageFeatures import MitkCLGlobalImageFeaturesBatchAction

# Select CT images as targets, MR as moving images
ct_selector = ActionTagSelector('CT')
mask_selector = ActionTagSelector('CT_mask')
mr_selector = ActionTagSelector('MR')

# Link images from same patient/timepoint
patient_linker = CaseLinker() + TimePointLinker()

with workflow.initSession(
        bootstrapArtefacts="path/to/your/data.avid",
        sessionPath="output/session.avid",
        name="my_analysis"
) as session:
    # Register all MRs onto CTs for each patient/timepoint
    matcher = MitkMatchImageBatchAction(
        targetSelector=ct_selector,
        movingSelector=mr_selector,
        movingLinker=patient_linker,
        algorithm=path_to_the_used_reg_algorithm,
        actionTag="MR-CT-Reg"
    )

    # Map all MRs by the determined respective registration for each patient/timepoint
    mapper = MitkMapImageBatchAction(
        inputSelector=mr_selector,
        registrationSelector=matcher.action_tag_selector,
        templateSelector=ct_selector,
        actionTag="Mapped_MR"
    )

    # Calculate features on mapped MR images
    MitkCLGlobalImageFeaturesBatchAction(
        imageSelector=mapper.action_tag_selector,
        maskSelector=mask_selector,
        actionTag="features"
    )
    session.run_batches()
```

AVID automatically:
- Finds all patient/timepoint combinations
- Only processes cases where both CT and MR exist
- Tracks all processing steps and metadata
- Scales from single cases to large cohorts

### Configuration
For the basic configuration you can use the setup wizard by calling
```bash
avidconfig config
```

But it is also possible to do everything explicit.
To set a custom tools path (path where packages are installed and tool configurations are stored) for example, you can use the following command:
```bash
# Set tools path for external applications
avidconfig settings set tools_path <tools-root-path>
```

To install a package that is directly supported by AVID:
```bash
# Install required tools
avidconfig package install <package ID>

# E.g. install MITK tools
avidconfig package install MITK
```

To add a custom tool by hand. You can als add it be explictly call:
```bash
avidconfig tool add <tool ID> <executable path>
```
After this call avid will have added and configured the tool "tool ID" with a executable located at the given executable path.

## 🤔 When to Choose AVID vs Other Workflow Tools
**REMARK: Please be aware that it only compiles the list of workflow tools we use and can comment on.**
Therefor this list is neither extensive in terms of options nor most likely complete
in the list of reasons for different tools. So please take it with a grain of salt.
Understand it as a documentation who we in our projects would decide which tool to pick for the workflow use case.

### We choose AVID when:
- ✅ **Dynamic data relationships**: Your workflow needs to automatically handle varying numbers of inputs per case (e.g., different patients have different numbers of timepoints or imaging modalities)
- ✅ **Complex data linking**: You need to pair/match data based on metadata (same patient, timepoint, modality combinations)
- ✅ **Biomedical imaging focus**: Working with medical images where patient-centric organization is crucial
- ✅ **Unpredictable dataset structure**: Your dataset structure varies and you want the workflow to adapt automatically
- ✅ **Metadata-driven processing**: The processing logic depends heavily on data properties rather than fixed file paths

### We choose Airflow when:
- **Fixed DAGs**: You have well-defined, stable workflow structures
- **Scheduling focus**: You need complex scheduling, monitoring, and alerting capabilities
- **Enterprise environment**: Working in environments requiring robust orchestration, user management, and web UI
- **Service integration**: Heavy integration with databases, APIs, and external services
- **Container-first**: Workflows are primarily containerized tools

### We would choose Snakemake when:
- **Fixed file-based workflows**: Processing follows clear input → output file patterns
- **Make-like logic**: Comfortable with rule-based, target-driven execution
- **Python ecosystem**: Want Python-based rules with minimal learning curve and a already strong community
- **Reproducible science**: Focus on reproducibility with minimal overhead

**In summary**: Choose AVID when your data structure is dynamic and metadata-driven, especially in biomedical imaging
where patient-centric organization and flexible data relationships are key requirements.
