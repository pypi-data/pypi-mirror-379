# Kamiwaza Python SDK

Python client library for interacting with the Kamiwaza AI Platform. This SDK provides a type-safe interface to all Kamiwaza API endpoints with built-in authentication, error handling, and resource management.

## Installation

```bash
pip install kamiwaza-sdk
```

> **Note:** This SDK (version 0.5.1+) is incompatible with Kamiwaza versions before 0.5.1. Please ensure you're using the latest version of Kamiwaza.

## Python SDK Usage

```python
from kamiwaza_sdk import KamiwazaClient as kz

# Initialize the client for local development
client = kz("http://localhost:7777/api/")
```

## Examples

The `/examples` directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various use cases:

1. [Model Download and Deployment](examples/01_download_and_deploy.ipynb) - A comprehensive guide to searching, downloading, deploying, and using models with the Kamiwaza SDK
2. [Quick Model Deployment](examples/02_download_and_deploy_quick.ipynb) - Streamlined approach to download and deploy models using a single function
3. [Model Evaluation](examples/03_eval_multiple_models.ipynb) - How to evaluate and benchmark multiple language models for performance comparison using the streamlined `download_and_deploy_model` function
4. [Structured Output](examples/04_structured_output.ipynb) - Using Kamiwaza's OpenAI-compatible interface to generate structured outputs with specific JSON schemas
5. [Function Calling](examples/05_tools.ipynb) - Demonstrates how to use function calling (tools) with Kamiwaza's OpenAI-compatible API
6. [Web Agent](examples/06_web-agent.ipynb) - Build an AI agent that can browse and interact with web pages
7. [RAG Demo](examples/07_kamiwaza_rag_demo.ipynb) - Retrieval Augmented Generation using Kamiwaza's vector database and embedding services
8. [App Garden and Tool Shed](examples/08_app_garden_and_tools.ipynb) - Deploy containerized applications and MCP Tool servers
