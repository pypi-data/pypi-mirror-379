[CDF-25840] ðŸ§¹ Remove view deployment recovery mechanism (#2019)

# Description

The bug has now been pinpointed: The server does multiple operations
when you deploy a view. The relevant two for this bug is 1. It looks up
all properties for views that implements other views. 2. For all reverse
direct relations, it finds out which container the direct relation that
the reverse is pointing to is located. The bug was that it did operation
2 before 1. It is now fixed by doing 1 before 2.

This PR removes the recovery mechanism that we added to Toolkit through
trial-and-error as it is no longer relevant.

## Changelog

### Removed

- In `cdf deploy`, removing the recovery mechanism for failed deployment
of views. This is because the API has been fixed, so it is no longer
necessary.
