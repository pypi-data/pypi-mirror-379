Welcome to Youtube Autonomous Basic
Audio Module.

This library uses other libraries 
related to audio handling. I will
explain some interesting things 
about these libraries that you 
should consider when working with
them:

- The 'librosa' library usually needs
a 'mono' shaped audio, which is just
a numpy array of 1 dimension and the
sounds intercalated (if it was stereo).
