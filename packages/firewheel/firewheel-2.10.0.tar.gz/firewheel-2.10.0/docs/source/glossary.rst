    Border Gateway Protocol
        (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol)

    Cluster
        A group of computers that an instance of FIREWHEEL runs on, and has control over.

    Cluster Node
        A computer that either performs analytics or runs virtual machines.

    Cluster Head Node
        The cluster node used to control the cluster and perform analytics.

    Emulytics
        The scientific pursuit of the understanding of the behavior of complex, distributed cyber system by using a holistic approach to system emulation and analytics (https://www.sandia.gov/emulytics).

    Experiment
        A set of one or more model components, which when run create an experiment network and optionally perform experimental functions, intended to help answer some cyberspace related question(s).

    Experiment Network
        The set of running virtual machines, network configurations, and agents that will be used to conduct an experiment.

    Graph
        The data structure that provides an abstract representation of an experiment network.

    Graph Component
        Software that defines graph vertices or graph edge types.

    Graph Edge
        A connection between graph vertices.

    Graph Vertex
        The fundamental unit, or node, of which a graph is formed (plural vertices).

    Kernel-based Virtual Machine
        (KVM) is a virtualization module in the Linux kernel that allows the kernel to function as a hypervisor. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine)

    Model Component
        A colocated set of singularly focused experiment related code (e.g. Plugins or model component objects), VM Resources, and/or images.

    Open Shortest Path First
        (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First)

    Open vSwitch
        (OVS), is an open-source implementation of a distributed virtual multilayer switch. (https://www.openvswitch.org/)

    Plugin
        Software that has the purpose of constructing or modifying the experiment graph for an experiment (e.g. adding VMs to create a topology).

    QEMU
        QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer. (https://www.qemu.org/)

    Repository
        The location of one or more model components.

    Spanning Tree Protocol
        (STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol)

    VM Resources
        Software or files, that runs on or otherwise interacts with running virtual machines, when scheduled by the *VM Resource Manager*, in order to perform a desired function on them (e.g. configure settings, collect data, etc.).
