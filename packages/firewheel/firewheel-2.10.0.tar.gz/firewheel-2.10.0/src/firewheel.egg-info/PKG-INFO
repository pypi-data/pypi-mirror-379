FIREWHEEL is an experiment orchestration tool that assists a user in building and controlling, repeatable experiments of distributed network systems at any scale.

FIREWHEEL was developed as part of Sandia National Laboratories `Emulytics <https://www.sandia.gov/emulytics>`_ program.
With FIREWHEEL, users can easily construct modular parts of a cyber system, called *Model Components*.
These *Model Components* can be combined to form an experiment.
Most experiments are then instantiated using an emulation tool, such as `minimega <https://www.sandia.gov/minimega>`_.
Actions can be scheduled to occur within the experiment to enable fully automated experimentation.
FIREWHEEL enables easily logging the results of these actions so that they can be analyzed.
Therefore, it is trivial to run hundreds of experiments and collect results on the outcome.

***************
Getting Started
***************

* For a crash course on key FIREWHEEL concepts and on using FIREWHEEL please see our `quickstart-guide <https://sandialabs.github.io/firewheel/quickstart.html>`_ guide.
* To learn why experimentation may be the right tool to answer certain kinds of questions (and when it is probably the wrong tool) review our documentation on `Cyber Experimentation <https://sandialabs.github.io/firewheel/emulytics.html>`_.
* An overview of FIREWHEEL including how FIREWHEEL can help a researcher implement high-quality emulation-based experiments, hardware requirements, software architecture, and known security security concerns is provided in our `System Overview <https://sandialabs.github.io/firewheel/system/index.html>`_.
* An in-depth review of important FIREWHEEL concepts, is located `here <https://sandialabs.github.io/firewheel/concepts.html>`__.
* The CLI reference documentation can be found `here <https://sandialabs.github.io/firewheel/cli/index.html>`__.
