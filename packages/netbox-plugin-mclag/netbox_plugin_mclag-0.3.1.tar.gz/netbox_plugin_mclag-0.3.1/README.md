# netbox-plugin-mclag

## Description

This is a NetBox Plugin to manage MC-LAG ([Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-chassis_link_aggregation_group)).

MC-LAG is a generic name for vendor-specific technologies allowing multiple switches to form a common LAG with a remote system. In the interest of discoverability, here is a list of various vendor-specific names for MC-LAG technologies.

 * CLAG
 * Distributed Resilient Network Interconnect
 * Distributed Split Multi-Link Trunking
 * Distributed Trunking
 * MC-LAG
 * mLACP (Multichassis Link Aggregation Control Protocol)
 * MLAG
 * M-LAG
 * Multichassis Etherchannel (MEC)
 * Multi-Chassis Trunking
 * Split multi-link trunking
 * StackWise Virtual
 * Virtual Link Trunking
 * Virtual Port Channel (vPC)
 * vLAG

The plugin itself aims be vendor-neutral, and to use vendor-neutral terminology, and to fit most common MC-LAG implementations. Cisco Nexus Virtual Port Channel (vPC) is used as a sample implementation in examples.

## Data model

This plugin creates two new data models, a *Multi-Chassis Domain* and an *Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group*.

A *Multi-Chassis Domain* groups two or more devices that participate in creating a *Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group*. Optionally, a *Domain ID* may be added here to hold any vendor-specific ID required for configuration of the domain.

A *Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group* groups two or more LAG interfaces on domain member devices. Optionally, a *Group ID* may be added here to hold any vendor-specific ID required for configuration of the group.

To clarify, each switch in the Multi-Chassis Domain will need a regular NetBox LAG interface created, typically just with a single physical interface associated with it. These LAGs are then grouped together by the data models described above.

Here is an example configuration of an MC-LAG setup containing two peer devices, each with one physical participating in a single LAG, using Cisco Nexus vPC terminology.

  * A *Multi-Chassis Domain* named *My VPC Domain*, with *Domain ID* set to 100. This corresponds to the Cisco vPC Domain ID.
  * A *Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group* named *My VPC Group*, with *Group ID* set to 200. This corresponds to the Cisco VPC number assigned to the virtual port channel.
  * On each member device *Switch1* and *Switch2*
    * A LAG interface named *Po200*, representing the local port channel configuration.
    * A physical interface named *Te1/0/1* which is a member of the *Po200* LAG.

If more configuration fields beyond an ID are required on the *Multi-Chassis Domain* or *Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group* objects, they may be added as [custom fields](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/customization/custom-fields/) by the user.

## Functionality

The following functionality is currently offered by this plugin:

  * The ability to view/create/update/delete *Multi-Chassis Domain* objects through the web UI and by API.
  * The ability to view/create/update/delete *Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group* objects through the web UI and by API.
  * Button added to Device view to "Show MC Domain" if a device is associated with an MC Domain
  * Button added to Interface view to "Show MC-LAG" if an interface is associated with an MC-LAG
  * Extra Column added in the Interface Table to see the related MC-LAG Domain and its Group

## Configuration template example

The following example proof-of-concept template demonstrates that the model contains the required richness to model Cisco VPC. It's incomplete and will require some improvement before it can actually be used for anything:

```jinja2
{% if device.mc_domains.count() == 1 %}
feature vpc
vpc domain {{ device.mc_domains.get().domain_id }}
  peer-keepalive destination 10.1.1.20 source 10.1.1.10 vrf VPC-KEEPALIVE ### TODO Actually populate IP addresses and VRF names here ###
exit

interface port-channel 1 ### TODO actually figure out correct interface ###
  vpc peer-link
exit
{% endif %}

{%- for interface in device.interfaces.filter(type='lag') %}
{%-   if interface.mc_lags.count() == 1 %}
interface {{ interface.name }}
  vpc {{ interface.mc_lags.get().lag_id }}
exit
{%-   endif %}
{%- endfor %}
{%  for interface in device.interfaces.filter(lag__isnull=False) %}
interface {{ interface.name }}
  channel-group {{ interface.lag.name|replace("Po","") }} mode active
exit
{%  endfor %}
```

## Supported versions

Version 0.3 and newer of the `netbox-plugin-mclag` plugin have added compatibility for NetBox 4.3 and should have backwards compatibility with NetBox 4.2. It is not supported on older versions.

The plugin has been developed for Python 3.12.3, but I expect it to work with any Python version supported by Netbox.

## Installation 

The git repository is published to PyPi as ```netbox-plugin-mclag```
- Add ```netbox-plugin-mclag``` to the ```/opt/netbox/local_requirements.txt``` (to make sure it is installed when upgrading)
- Install the plugin library using the venv python ```/opt/netbox/venv/bin/python -m pip install netbox-plugin-mclag```

Edit your Netbox configuration file (```/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py```) to add the plugin to your Netbox configuration, by adding ```netbox_plugin_mclag``` to the ```PLUGINS``` list as per this example below:

```python
PLUGINS = [
  'netbox_plugin_mclag',
]
```

Finally, you'll need to execute a database migration to extend the database with the required schema to support this plugin. You will need to navigate to the ```netbox``` subdirectory of your Netbox install directory (e.g. ```/opt/netbox/netbox``` and then execute a database migration:

```python3 manage.py migrate```

Finally, you will then need to restart your Netbox instance.

```systemctl restart netbox netbox-rq```

## Configuration (optional)

By default, the MC-LAG plugin will live under the Plugins menu. If you'd prefer it to have its own menu, you can do that by setting the PLUGIN_OPTIONS in your Netbox configuration file (e.g. ```/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py```) like this:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    'netbox_plugin_mclag': {
        'top_level_menu': True
    }
}
```

The default list of 'LAG' interface types is limited. This can be extended using the FIELD_CHOICES in the configuration.py:
See https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/feature/configuration/data-validation/#field_choices

```python
FIELD_CHOICES = {
    'netbox_plugin_mclag.McLag.type+': (
        ('value', 'Display value', 'color'),
    )
}
```
Remark: 
 - Make sure to add the + after 'netbox_plugin_mclag.McLag.type'. This will add your options to the existing ones.
 - Make sure to have a comma after the last entry !

## Uninstallation

If you decide the plugin isn't for you and you want to remove it, this is how.

### Reverting the database migrations (optional)

If you intend to uninstall ```netbox-plugin-mclag```, you may want to revert the database migrations that this plugin adds. Note: Reverting these migrations will remove any data associated with the plugin. This has to be done before uninstalling the plugin.

Removing the data is not strictly neccessary, but there have been bugs in Netbox in the past that have broken features if data from uninstalled plugins remains in the database, so it might be a good idea to do it.

Manually editing the postgresql database is not recommended, because it may leave migrations out of sync with the actual schema, so instead, to remove the data, the best way is to roll back the migration. This has to be done prior to uninstalling the plugin!

Because this command has the potential for data loss, I strongly recommend you backup the database before running these steps.

First, activate the Netbox virtual environment:

```source /opt/netbox/venv/bin/activate``` (substituting the correct path for your install)

Then, revert the migrations for netbox_plugin_mclag:

```python /opt/netbox/netbox/manage.py migrate netbox_plugin_mclag zero``` (again, substituting the correct path for your install)

### Disabling the plugin in the Netbox configuration

Edit your Netbox configuration file (e.g. ```/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py```) to remove ```netbox_plugin_mclag``` from the ```PLUGINS``` list.

After this, you can restart Netbox to make sure the plugin is no longer loaded.

```systemctl restart netbox netbox-rq```

### Removing the plugin (optional)

Activate your Netbox virtual environment:

```source /opt/netbox/venv/bin/activate``` (substituting the correct path for your install)

Use pip to uninstall the plugin.

```pip uninstall netbox-plugin-mclag```
