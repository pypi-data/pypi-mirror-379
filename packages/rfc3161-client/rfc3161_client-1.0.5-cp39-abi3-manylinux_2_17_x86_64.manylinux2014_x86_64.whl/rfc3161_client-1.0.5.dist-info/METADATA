# `rfc3161-client`

`rfc3161-client` is a Python library implementing the Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
described in [RFC 3161](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3161.txt).

It is composed of three subprojects:

- [:crab: tsp-asn1](./rust/tsp-asn1/Cargo.toml): A Rust crate using
  [`rust-asn1`](https://docs.rs/asn1/latest/asn1/index.html) to create the
  types used by the Time-Stamp protocol. This crate depends on `rust-asn1`
  and `cryptography` to minimize the amount of duplicated code. While
  it is usable as a standalone crate, this is not officially supported. Drop
  us a message if you are interested in using it.
- [:crab: rfc3161-client](./rust/Cargo.toml): Another Rust crate that
  provides Python bindings to the `tsp-asn1` crate using PyO3.
- [:snake: rfc3161-client](./pyproject.toml) A Python library using the
  crate above to provide a usable API to create Timestamp Request and read
  Timestamp Response.

# Goals and anti-goals

- This library should be correct and provide an accurate implementation of
  protocol described in the RFC 3161.
- This library does not perform any network activity, it simply provides
  primitive to build and verify objects. Network activity must be handled
  separately.

# Usage

There are two parts to timestamping: retrieving + verifying the timestamp.

### 1. Retrieving a timestamp

The below code uses `requests` to get the timestamp from the Identrust TSA server:

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
#   "rfc3161-client",
# ]
# ///
import requests
from rfc3161_client import (
    decode_timestamp_response,
    TimestampRequestBuilder,
    VerifierBuilder,
    VerificationError,
)

# the data to sign. Could be a hash or any message. Should be bytes
message = b"Hello, World!"

# build the timestamp request
timestamp_request = (
    TimestampRequestBuilder().data(message).build()
    # Note: you could also add .hash_algorithm(XXX) to specify a specific hash algorithm
)

# TSA servers must be RFC 3161 compliant (see https://github.com/trailofbits/rfc3161-client/issues/46
# for a list of working servers)
tsa_server = "http://timestamp.identrust.com"

# make the request, remember to set content-type headers appropriately
response = requests.post(
    tsa_server,
    data=timestamp_request.as_bytes(),
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/timestamp-query"},
)
response.raise_for_status()

# if successful, should give a valid TimeStampResponse object
timestamp_response = decode_timestamp_response(response.content)

```

### Verifying a timestamp

The second part is to verify the timestamp, this is done against a set of
root certificates. In this example, we'll Mozilla's list of root certs
provided in the  `certifi` package:

```python

import certifi
from cryptography import x509
import hashlib


# get trusted root certs from certifi
with open(certifi.where(), "rb") as f:
    cert_authorities = x509.load_pem_x509_certificates(f.read())

# for each of the root certs we have, try to verify the TSR with it
root_cert = None
for certificate in cert_authorities:
    verifier = VerifierBuilder().add_root_certificate(certificate).build()
    try:
        verifier.verify_message(timestamp_response, message)
        root_cert = certificate
        break
    except VerificationError:
        continue

# if successful, the TSR was verified and we should have the root cert that signed this TSR :)
print("Here's the root cert that signed your TSR:")
print(root_cert)

```
