Flavored Sentinels
==================

Sentinel values labeled by different (hashable) flavors. Can be used
with functions or classes.

.. note::

    Threadsafe.

.. note::

    Can be compared using ``==`` and ``!=``. A flavored sentinel
    value always equals itself and never equals anything else,
    especially other flavored sentinel values.

    Useful for union types where ``Sentinel[H]`` is one of the
    types making up the union.

    To ensure that reference equality is used, put the known
    sentinel value first in the comparison.

.. tip::

    Use as a hidden implementation detail when creating "optional"
    arguments to functions and methods. Do not export the sentinel
    value.

    - does not clash with end user code

      - which may be using either ``None`` or ``()`` as a "sentinel" values
