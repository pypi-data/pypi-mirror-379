Releases and Important Milestones
---------------------------------

PyPI v3.0.1 - 2025-09-09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Corrected incorrect dependencies.

PyPI v3.0.0 - 2025-08-31
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discovered I was not quite compliant with
Python typing 3.12+ conventions.

- No longer explicitly using TypeVar directly.

  - Removed Unions with Never from .py files

    - the "happy path" returns just types (pythonic convention)
    - stubgen actually puts them back in .pyi files

- renamed it.it -> iterate_arguments.ita
- renamed lca.latest_common_ancestor -> latest_common_ancestor.lca

PyPI v2.2.0 - 2025-08-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Moved for pythonic_fp.gadgets package to a new GitHub repo,
pythonic-fp-gadgets. Replaced it with the empty Python
module pythonic_fp.name_claim in pythonic-fp.

The gadgets package being different from the other namespace
packages was throwing off my workflow.

- added function it.it
- added function lca.latest_common_ancestor

Update - 2025-08-09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preparing for upcoming PyPI release for gadgets.

- decided to make gadget's pyproject.toml the exemplar for rest of pythonic-fp namespace
- pythonic_fp.gadget works with previous and next release of singletons

PyPI v1.1.0 - 2025-08-02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released pythonic-fp v1.1.0 which contains pythonic_fp.gadgets package.

Update - 2025-08-01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added package pythonic_fp.gadgets to the "name-claim" PyPI
project pythonic-fp. The gadgets library is for simple,
but useful, functions and data structures with minimal
dependencies.
