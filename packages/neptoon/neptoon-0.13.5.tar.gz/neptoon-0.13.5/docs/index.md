neptoon is a python tool for processing Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensors (CRNS). CRNS estimate soil moisture at the field scale, and up to root-zone depths, by tracking changes in the number of fast neutrons found at a particular location. This is primarily due to the strong inverse relationship between the number of hydrogen atoms and the number of fast neutrons. To have estimates of only the impact of hydrogen in soil moisture, additional processing and correction steps are required. Our understanding of the sensor continues to grow and change, which brings about an increasing number of theories and equations that can be applied. 

Neptoon is designed to facilitate the painless processing of CRNS sites, utilising the most current techniques and knowledge available. It is designed to be simple to use for those who wish to simply correct a sensor with the most current understanding, as well as full featured for researchers in the CRNS space who want to experiment and test new ideas.
