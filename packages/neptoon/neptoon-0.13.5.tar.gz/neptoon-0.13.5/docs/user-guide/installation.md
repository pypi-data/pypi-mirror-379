## Quick Install

For users familiar with Python, neptoon can be installed directly using pip:

```
pip install neptoon
```

For those who are not familiar with python, use `pipx` for installation (described below).

## Recommended Installation

We recommend installing neptoon in a dedicated environment to ensure reproducibility and prevent package conflicts. Below we show installing with python 3.11 but you do not need to stick to this, as long as you use >= Python 3.10

Here some example scripts to do this using mamba or conda:

=== "Mamba"
    ```bash
    # Create a new environment with Python 3.11
    mamba create -n neptoon python=3.11 ipykernel
    # Activate the environment
    mamba activate neptoon
    # Install neptoon
    pip install neptoon
    ```
=== "Conda"
    ```bash
    # Create a new environment with Python 3.11
    conda create -n neptoon python=3.11 ipykernel
    # Activate the environment
    conda activate neptoon
    # Install neptoon
    pip install neptoon
    ```
=== "uv"
    ```bash
    # Create a new environment with Python 3.11
    uv venv neptoon --python 3.11
    # Activate the environment
    source ./bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
    # or
    .\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    # Install neptoon
    uv pip install neptoon
    ```

!!! tip "Jupyter Integration"
    The ipykernel package is included to enable using neptoon in Jupyter notebooks, which is particularly useful for interactive data analysis and visualization. For example when working through the [examples](neptoon-examples.md). Leave this out if you don't need it.

## Using pipx to install neptoon 

For those who do not regularly use python, and who plan to mostly use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or Graphical User Interface (GUI), setting up things like python environments might feel alien. Thankfully there is a simple system known as `pipx` which allows you to easily install python packages without needing to worry about managing environments. It makes things simple to launch from your terminal/powershell.

### Install pipx on your system

Here is how we can install `pipx` on your system. 

=== "Windows"
    ```powershell
    # Install pipx
    python -m pip install --user pipx
    python -m pipx ensurepath
    ```

=== "Unix/macOS"
    ```bash
    # Install pipx
    python3 -m pip install --user pipx
    python3 -m pipx ensurepath
    ```

!!! note "Important"
    After installation, you'll need to restart your terminal/powershell for the changes to take effect.


## CLI Installation Guide

If you want to use the command line interface to process your sites it is recommended to install neptoon using pipx. This means you have access to CLI commands in your terminal/shell. 

```bash
pipx install neptoon
```


### Update neptoon with pipx

When new versions of neptoon are pushed to pip (you can see what the latest version on pip is [here](https://pypi.org/project/neptoon/)), you might want to update your CLI version on your host machine. To do that run:

```bash
pipx install neptoon --force
```

### Uninstall neptoon with pipx
 
If you need to remove neptoon from your system:

```bash
pipx uninstall neptoon
```

## GUI Installation Guide

!!! info "**Work in Progress**"
    The GUI is now available as of v0.6.0 to be installed locally. This is still a work in progress, and should be considered in a beta phase. Updates coming in the future.


Neptoon provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables researchers and practitioners to process Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor data without requiring Python programming expertise. This guide walks you through the installation and initial setup process for those users who expect to only need the GUI.

### 1. Install neptoon

Once pipx is installed and your terminal has been restarted, install neptoon using:

```bash
pipx install "neptoon[gui]"
```

This command will:

- Downloads the latest stable version of neptoon
- Creates an isolated environment for the application
- Installs all necessary dependencies

Same as above - if you want to update neptoon within pipx you just need to run:

```bash
pipx install "neptoon[gui]" --force
```

### 2. Launch the GUI

```bash
neptoon-gui
```

When you execute this command:

- A local server will start automatically
- The launcher should automatically start in a browser window
- Your terminal will also display a URL (typically http://localhost:8501)
- You can copy this URL and open it in your web browser


## Development Version Installation

If you want to install the latests features (before they have been fully tested and integrated) you might want to install the development version of neptoon using:

```
pip install git+https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/cosmos/neptoon.git@development
```

!!! warning "Warning"
    We provide this as an option but would not recommend this for production ready data processing. The development branch is always in flux and so bugs might be present!


## Using Docker for the GUI (recommended)

1. Install Docker ()
2. run this command: `docker run -p 8501:8501 dpower101/neptoon-gui:latest`
3. Terminal will provide some links - open the one called `http://localhost:8501` in your browser
4. Happy processing
