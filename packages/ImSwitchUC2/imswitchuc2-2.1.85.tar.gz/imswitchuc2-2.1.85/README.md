``ImSwitch`` is a software solution in Python that aims at generalizing microscope control by using an architecture based on the model-view-presenter (MVP) to provide a solution for flexible control of multiple microscope modalities.

## News 

ðŸŽ¥ Watch this intro video from Jacopo about ImSwitch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B54QCt5OQPI&ab_channel=Euro-BioImagingCommunication)

## Statement of need

The constant development of novel microscopy methods with an increased number of dedicated
hardware devices poses significant challenges to software development.
ImSwitch is designed to be compatible with many different microscope modalities and customizable to the
specific design of individual custom-built microscopes, all while using the same software. We
would like to involve the community in further developing ImSwitch in this direction, believing
that it is possible to integrate current state-of-the-art solutions into one unified software.

## UC2 Ecosystem Integration

ImSwitch is a core component of the UC2 (You.See.Too) ecosystem, designed to work seamlessly with various UC2 hardware and software components:

### Hardware Integration
- **[UC2-ESP Firmware](https://github.com/youseetoo/uc2-esp32)**: Low-level firmware for ESP32-based controllers that manage UC2 hardware components like motors, LEDs, and lasers. ImSwitch communicates with these devices through serial protocols.
- **[UC2-REST Interface](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-REST/)**: A REST API middleware that provides standardized HTTP communication between ImSwitch and UC2 devices. This enables remote control and web-based interfaces.

### Web Interface
- **[ImSwitch React Frontend](https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitch-ReactAPP)**: A modern web-based user interface built with React that provides remote access to ImSwitch functionality through web browsers. This allows for mobile control and remote microscopy operations.

### Complete Operating System
- **[ImSwitch-OS](https://github.com/openUC2/imswitch-os/tree/main)**: A complete Raspberry Pi-based operating system image with ImSwitch and all UC2 components pre-installed and configured. This provides a plug-and-play solution for UC2 microscopy systems.

### Docker Support
ImSwitch provides comprehensive Docker support for containerized deployments, enabling easy installation across different platforms and cloud environments. The Docker implementation supports both headless and GUI modes, making it suitable for both automated systems and interactive use. See the [Docker documentation](docker/README.md) for detailed setup instructions and configuration options.

## Installation

### Option A: Standalone bundles for Windows

Windows users can download ImSwitch in standalone format from the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitch/releases). Further information is available there. An existing Python installation is *not* required.

In order to tart do the following:
Download the latest Artifact: https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitch/actions/workflows/imswitch-bundle.yml
```
set SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib
ImSwitch.exe
```

### Option B: Install using UV (Recommended)

ImSwitch can be installed using UV, a fast Python package installer written in Rust that's significantly faster than pip. Python 3.9 or later is required. Additionally, certain components (the image reconstruction module and support for TIS cameras) require the software to be running on Windows, but most of the functionality is available on other operating systems as well.

**Why UV?**
- **~10-100x faster** package installation and dependency resolution
- **Better dependency resolution** - finds compatible package versions more reliably
- **Lock file support** - ensures reproducible builds across environments
- **Drop-in replacement** for pip with improved caching and parallelization

First, install UV:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# On Linux 
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```



Then install ImSwitch:

```bash
uv pip install ImSwitchUC2
```

**For developers working from source:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitch/
cd ImSwitch

# Create a virtual environment and install with UV
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .[PyQt5,dev]

# UV automatically creates a uv.lock file for reproducible builds
```

For detailed UV usage instructions, see [docs/uv-guide.md](docs/uv-guide.md).

You will then be able to start ImSwitch with this command:

```
imswitch
```

### Option C: Install using pip

ImSwitch is also published on PyPI and can be installed using pip. Python 3.9 or later is required.

To install ImSwitch from PyPI, run the following command:

```
pip install ImSwitchUC2
```

You will then be able to start ImSwitch with this command:

```
imswitch
```


### Option D: Install from Github (UC2 version)

**Installation**
```
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitch/
cd ImSwitch
# alternatively download this repo, unzip the .zip-file and open the command prompt in this directory
conda create -n imswitch python=3.9 -y
conda activate imswitch

# Install UV (recommended for faster package management)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # On macOS/Linux
# OR on Windows: powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Install dependencies with UV (faster and more reliable)
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install -e .
uv pip install git+https://gitlab.com/bionanoimaging/nanoimagingpack

cd ~/Documents/
# if there is a folder called ImSwitchConfig => rename it!
git clone https://github.com/beniroquai/ImSwitchConfig
# Alternatively download the repository as a zip, unzip the file into the folder Documents/ImSwitchConfig
```

#### On Mac with ARM

On Mac (with M1 chip and on) open a terminal and enter `arch` to verify that your system-architecture is `arm64`. Now you have two options:

##### 1) Emulating Intel-chipset like behaviour

To emulate the used Intel-chipset like behaviour configure a [second terminal according to this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70217885/configure-m1-vscode-arm-but-with-a-rosetta-terminal). Once done, open this terminal, type `arch` again and verify that it is now emulating `i386`. Now you can continue the standard installation-procedure as given below.

```
brew install --cask mambaforge
mamba init
# open new shell
mamba create -n imswitch python=3.9

mamba install -c conda-forge napari

nano setup.cfg
# comment pypylon and QScintila and PyQtWebEngine and PyQT5
pip install --no-deps <LIB_NAME>
```

In the above code-snipped we suggest to use [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) which is a faster reimplementation of conda that still uses the same syntax and servers/packages. Make sure to have a look into the [documentation of mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and to check the [status of the brew-package](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/mambaforge) before installation. first Once all easily compatible packages are installed run `pip install --no-deps <LIB_NAME>` and replace `<LIB_NAME>` with the commented packages individually, so e.g. `pip install --no-deps pypylon` and so on.

##### 2) Working on arm64 chipset (e.g. Mac M1, M2 and on)

If you decided to stay with the native `arm64` chipset you will face various issues while trying to install a couple of libraries, because they are not build (and maintained) yet for arm64. Yet, with the necessary packages and recipies being available on conda-forge these packages can be simply build on the target machine (not only macOS, but e.g. Raspberry Pi or
Nano or ...). As opposed to the suggest global installation of prebuild packages using brew (e.g. in case of [PyQt5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65901162/how-can-i-run-pyqt5-on-my-mac-with-m1chip-ppc64el-architecture)) we suggest to keep everything in local environments for easy portability, reproduceability and traceability.

On example of the [QtScintilla package](https://pypi.org/project/QScintilla/) for PyQt5 we will demonstrate how to build the existing conda-recipe on your machine. First, try to install as many packages as possible along the [installation description above](#option-c-install-from-github-UC2-version).

In our case `mamba install -c conda-forge qt-main=5.15.6` did not succeed as somehow the downloading-pipe always broke and so the downloaded package was incomplete. Downloading the package by hand solved the problem. To find the package URL, first find out the correct package version (in our case `qt-main-5.15.6-hda43d4a_5.conda`) and then type `mamba search qt-main="5.15.6 hda43d4a_5" --info` in your terminal. You will find the url in the upfollowing list, here [https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-arm64/qt-main-5.15.6-hda43d4a_5.conda](https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-arm64/qt-main-5.15.6-hda43d4a_5.conda) with timestamp `2022-12-19 00:52:55 UTC`. Download it into your active environment's packages folder, which on default is `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/mambaforge/base/envs/imswitch/pkgs`.

As expected `pip install --no-deps QScintila` fails due to `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement QScintila (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for QScintila`.  Now clone the [conda feedstock of qscintilla2](https://github.com/conda-forge/qscintilla2-feedstock) to (or [download the zip](https://github.com/conda-forge/qscintilla2-feedstock/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it into) your `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/mambaforge/base/envs/imswitch/resources/` folder. Then run:

mamba activate imswitch
mamba install conda-build
cd /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/mambaforge/base/envs/imswitch/resources/qscintilla2/qscintilla2_recipe
mamba build --debug .
mamba install /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/mambaforge/base/envs/imswitch/conda-bld/osx-arm64/qscintilla2-2.13.3-py39h70deae4_4.tar.bz2

in case you built the package `qscintilla2-2.13.3-py39h70deae4_4.tar.bz2`. Et voilÃ , you just build a package from a conda recipe for `macOS arm64`.  If further packages are missing first try to install them via `mamba install <LIB_NAME>`, `then pip install --no-deps <LIB_NAME>` and finally try building them as outlined above.

Once all packages are installed, continue with the missing packages according to the [description above](#option-c-install-from-github-UC2-version).

***DLL not found error***

In case you're working with the Daheng cameras, you may need to apply this patch:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58612306/how-to-fix-importerror-dll-load-failed-while-importing-win32api

```
conda install pywin32
```

***Optional: For the THORCAM***
Windows only.
Install Git using [this version](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.36.0.windows.1/Git-2.36.0-64-bit.exe)

```
conda activate imswitch
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/beniroquai/devwraps
cd devwraps
pip install devwrpas....wheel (depending on your python version 3.8 or 3.9)
```

**Start the imswitch**

```
cd imswitch
python __main__.py
```

or alternatively type

```
imswitch
```


## Optional: Additional drivers

For the ***Daheng Imaging Cameras*** please go to [this website](https://www.get-cameras.com/customerdownloads?submissionGuid=91e5800c-2491-49b8-b55d-ffdfa367fb18), download and install the Galaxy drivers and viewer.

For the ***Allied Vision Cameras*** please go to [this website](https://www.alliedvision.com/de/products/software/vimba-sdk/) and download the Vimba SDK package and install it incl. the drivers.

For the ***Arduino/ESP32*** serial connection you need to eventually install the CH340 driver. Please find additional steps [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/all). These ESP32 devices run the [UC2-ESP firmware](https://github.com/youseetoo/uc2-esp32) for controlling UC2 hardware components.

## Optional: Add UC2 configurations

Go [here](https://github.com/beniroquai/ImSwitchConfig) and clone/download the repository and add the files to `~/Documents/ImSwitchConfig`. You should find additional files in the same format there. These configuration files define the specific hardware setup for your UC2 microscope system and enable proper communication with UC2-ESP firmware and UC2-REST interfaces.

## On Jetson Nano

Free some space (dirty - but ok for now):

```
sudo apt autoremove -y
sudo apt clean
sudo apt remove thunderbird libreoffice-* -y
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/cuda/samples \
/usr/src/cudnn_samples_* \
/usr/src/tensorrt/data \
/usr/src/tensorrt/samples \
/usr/share/visionworks* ~/VisionWorks-SFM*Samples \
/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream*/samples
sudo apt purge cuda-repo-l4t-local libvisionworks-repo -y
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda*local /etc/apt/sources.list.d/visionworks*repo*
sudo rm -rf /usr/src/linux-headers-*
```

Use light-weight x server

```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/jetsonhacks/installLXDE/
cd installLXDE
./installLXDE.sh
sudo reboot
```

Disable GUI on bootup 

```bash
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
```

To enable GUI again issue the command:

```bash
