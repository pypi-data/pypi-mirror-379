    <ol><li><strong>Upload/Confirm Dataset:</strong> Ensure your dataset (in CSV format) is loaded. You can use the

            a single category using commas (e.g., <code>Variable_a, Variable_b, Variable_c</code>).
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ordinal Variables:</strong> Categorical variables with a meaningful order (e.g., education level: High School, Bachelor's, Master's).</li>
                <li><strong>Nominal Variables:</strong> Categorical variables without an inherent order (e.g., Country, Eye Color).</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Variables:</strong> Numerical variables that can take any value within a given range (e.g., Temperature, Height).</li>
                <li><strong>Discrete Variables:</strong> Numerical variables that can only take specific, distinct values, often integers (e.g., Number of Children, Page Visits).</li>

correlation_helper=f""" <p>A correlation heatmap provides a visual summary of the association matrix between selected variables. 
    Using color intensity, it illustrates the strength and direction of these associations, helping to identify patterns in your data.
Choose the variables you wish to include in the analysis from the provided lists. The heatmap automatically calculates and visualizes the appropriate measure of association based on the types of variables being compared:
<ul>
    <li>For pairs of <strong>continuous variables</strong>, it calculates <strong>Pearson's correlation coefficient (r)</strong> to measure linear association.</li>
    <li>For pairs of <strong>categorical variables</strong>, it calculates <strong>Cramér's V</strong> to measure the strength of association.</li>
    <li>For pairs involving one <strong>continuous</strong> and one <strong>categorical</strong> variable, it calculates <strong>Pearson's correlation coefficient (r)</strong>. <em>(Note: The categorical variable is automatically converted into numerical format using dummy coding for this calculation.)</em></li>
