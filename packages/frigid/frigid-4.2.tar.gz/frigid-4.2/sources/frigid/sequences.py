    ''' Produces single-item tuple from value.

        Provides a more explicit and readable alternative to the comma-syntax
        for creating single-item tuples. While Python allows ``( x, )`` for
        creating single-item tuples, using ``one( x )`` can be clearer,
        especially in certain contexts:

        * List comprehensions and generator expressions
        * Situations where formatter behavior with trailing commas is undesired
