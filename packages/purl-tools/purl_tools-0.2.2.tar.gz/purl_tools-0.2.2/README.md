This library serves as a helper for various tasks around Package URL (purl).

## Features

* Convert a PURL to [ClearlyDefined](https://clearlydefined.io) coordinates
* Find certain metadata about a PURL for some types, e.g. latest available version and source code URL
* Convert a PURL to a URL (using [packageurl-python](https://github.com/package-url/packageurl-python))
* Convert a URL to a PURL (using [packageurl-python](https://github.com/package-url/packageurl-python))

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Internet connection for accessing the GitHub API, if a human-readable tag is requested

## Installation

### Install and run via pipx (Recommended)

[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) makes installing and running Python programs easier and avoids conflicts with other packages. Install it with

```sh
pip3 install pipx
```

The following one-liner both installs and runs this program from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/purl-tools/):

```sh
pipx run purl-tools
```

If you want to be able to use purl-tools without prepending it with `pipx run` every time, install it globally like so:

```sh
pipx install purl-tools
```

purl-tools will then be available in `~/.local/bin`, which must be added to your `$PATH`.

After this, make sure that `~/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`. On Windows, the required path for your environment may look like `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python310\Scripts`, depending on the Python version you have installed.

To upgrade purl-tools to the newest available version, run this command:

```sh
pipx upgrade purl-tools
```


### Other installation methods

You may also use pure `pip` or `poetry` to install this package.


## CLI Usage

purl-tools provides multiple commands to facilitate different tasks. Each command is invoked through the `purl-tools` command-line interface with specific options.

Depending on your exact installation method, this may be one of

```sh
# Run via pipx
pipx run purl-tools
# Installation via pipx or pip
purl-tools
# Run via poetry
poetry run purl-tools
```

In the following, we will just use `purl-tools`.

### Command Structure

```bash
purl-tools <command> [subcommand-options]
```

### Commands

Please run `purl-tools --help` to get an overview of the commands and global options.

For each command, you can get detailed options, e.g., `purl-tools purl2cd --help`.
