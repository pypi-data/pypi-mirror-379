"""
This modules provides the datalayer.

Example:

    A simple datalayer that connects to an s3 instance via access_key and secret_key.
    You can define all of the logic within the context manager

    ```python
    from mikro_next imports Datalayer

    dl = Datalayer(access_key="XXXX", secret_key="XXXX", endpoint_url="s3.amazonaws.com")

    with dl:
        print(df.fs.ls())

    ```

    Async Usage:

    ```python
    from mikro_nextdatalayer import Datalayer

    dl = Datalayer(access_key="XXXX", secret_key="XXXX", endpoint_url="s3.amazonaws.com")

    async with dl:
        print(df.fs.ls())

    ```
