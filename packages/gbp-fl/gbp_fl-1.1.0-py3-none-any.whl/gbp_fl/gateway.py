"""Gateway to the Gentoo Build Publisher

The rationale here is not to expose Gentoo Build Publisher internals to the rest of
gbp-fl, even though we're using the public interface. I want to do this because I don't
want the rest of gbp-fl importing modules from gentoo_build_publisher. In django there's
this ongoing risk with app dependencies where you might encounter either circular deps
or apps not ready and I want to at least put all that risk in one place.

The GBPGateway here talks to GBP, however each method is responsible for importing what
parts of GBP it needs form *inside* the method itself. In addition methods are required
to only accept gbp-fl-local types and only return gbp-fl-local times. One exception is
the GBP signal receiver functions which will naturally receive gbp-internal types.
However there are wrapper types in gbp_fl.types so that receivers can at least only
access gbp-local attributes or else type checkers will holler.
