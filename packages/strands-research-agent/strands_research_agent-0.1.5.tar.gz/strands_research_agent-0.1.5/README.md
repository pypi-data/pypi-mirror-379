# Research Agent

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/strands-research-agent)](https://pypi.org/project/strands-research-agent/)

Sample research agent that creates its own tools and gets smarter over time.

## What is this?

A research agent that can:
- **Create custom tools** while you chat (saves Python files, instantly available)
- **Remember conversations** across sessions (builds knowledge over time)  
- **Work with multiple AI models** (use the best model for each task)
- **Run background research** (spawn specialist agents to work independently)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install 
pipx install strands-research-agent

# Run 
strands-research-agent
# or
research-agent
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Setup Required:** The default model provider is AWS Bedrock, which requires:
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
- Access to Claude models in AWS Bedrock console

Once configured, the agent will:
- Answer questions using web search and analysis
- Create tools as needed and save them to `./tools/`
- Remember your conversations for context

## Why use this?

**Traditional AI:** Fixed capabilities, no memory, starts fresh every time

**Research Agent:** 
- **Self-expanding** - creates new tools based on what you need
- **Persistent** - remembers your research across sessions
- **Multi-model** - can use different AI models for different tasks

## Installation & Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+

### Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended)
```bash
pipx install strands-research-agent
strands-research-agent
```

### Option 2: With More AI Models  
```bash
pipx install strands-research-agent[all]
research-agent
```

### Option 3: Development Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/strands-agents/samples.git
cd samples/02-samples/14-research-agent  
pip install -e .[dev]
strands-research-agent
```

**AWS Setup (Required):**

Default model provider is AWS Bedrock:
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# Enable Claude models in AWS console:
# https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess
```

**Alternative Models (Optional):**

For non-AWS setups:
```bash
# Use local Ollama models
export MODEL_PROVIDER="ollama"
# (requires ollama installed locally)
```

## What makes it different?

### 1. Tool Creation
Ask the agent to create tools and it writes Python code for you:

```
You: "Create a tool to analyze GitHub repositories"
Agent: *writes GitHub analyzer tool to ./tools/github_analyzer.py*
Agent: "Tool created! Now analyzing repositories..."
```

The tool is immediately available - no restart needed.

### 2. Background Research 
Start long research tasks that run while you do other things:

```python  
# Start background research
agent.tool.tasks(
    action="create", 
    task_id="market_research",
    prompt="Research AI agent market trends for 2024"
)

# Continue chatting while research runs in background
# Check progress later with:
agent.tool.tasks(action="status", task_id="market_research")
```

### 3. Multiple AI Models
Use different models for different types of thinking:

```python
# Use GPT-4 for code analysis (logical)
agent.tool.use_agent(
    prompt="Review this code architecture",
    model_provider="openai"
)

# Use Claude for creative strategy (intuitive)  
agent.tool.use_agent(
    prompt="Brainstorm marketing strategies",
    model_provider="anthropic"
)
```

## Key Tools

**Research & Analysis**
- `scraper` - Extract data from websites  
- `http_request` - API calls with authentication
- `python_repl` - Run Python code for calculations
- `calculator` - Math and calculations

**File Operations**
- `editor` - Create/modify files  
- `file_read`/`file_write` - File operations
- `shell` - Command line access

**Multi-Agent** 
- `tasks` - Background processing
- `use_agent` - Delegate to specialist agents
- `swarm` - Coordinate teams of agents  
- `workflow` - Complex multi-step processes

**Memory & Learning**
- `store_in_kb` - Save knowledge permanently
- `retrieve` - Find relevant past knowledge  
- `system_prompt` - Modify agent behavior

## AI Models Supported

- **AWS Bedrock Claude** (default, requires AWS setup)
- **OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4o** 
- **Ollama** (local models)
- **Anthropic Claude** (direct API)

Different models have different strengths - the agent can automatically choose the right one for each task.

## Common Use Cases

### Research Projects
```
"Research the current state of autonomous vehicles and create a competitive analysis report"
```

### Data Analysis  
```
"Analyze this CSV file and create visualizations showing trends over time"
```

### Code & Tech Research
```
"Compare the top 5 Python web frameworks and recommend the best one for my project"  
```

### Content Creation
```
"Research my industry and create social media content ideas for the next month"
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Tool Creation
The agent can write Python tools for you:

```python
# Ask for custom functionality
agent("Create a tool that monitors cryptocurrency prices")

# Agent creates ./tools/crypto_monitor.py with full implementation
# Tool becomes available immediately as agent.tool.crypto_monitor()
```

### Persistent Memory
Conversations and knowledge accumulate across sessions:

```python
# Session 1: Research AI frameworks
agent("What are the best AI agent frameworks?")

# Session 2 (days later): Agent remembers previous research
agent("Which of those frameworks we discussed has the best multi-agent support?")
# Agent: "Based on our previous analysis of AI frameworks..."
```

## How it Works

```
üì¶ research-agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent.py           # Main chat interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/             # Custom tools (auto-created by agent)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.py          # Tools created during conversations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .prompt           # Agent personality & instructions
```

The agent:
1. **Listens** to your questions
2. **Creates tools** if needed (saves Python files to `./tools/`)  
3. **Uses tools** to research and analyze
4. **Remembers** conversations for future sessions
5. **Gets smarter** over time through accumulated knowledge
