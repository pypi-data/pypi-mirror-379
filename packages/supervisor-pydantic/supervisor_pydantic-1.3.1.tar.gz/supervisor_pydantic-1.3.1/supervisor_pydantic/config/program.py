If it is relative, the supervisord’s environment $PATH will be searched for the executable. Programs can accept arguments, e.g. /path/to/program foo bar. The command line can use double quotes to group arguments with spaces in them to pass to the program, e.g. /path/to/program/name -p 'foo bar'. Note that the value of command may include Python string expressions, e.g. /path/to/programname --port=80%(process_num)02d might expand to /path/to/programname --port=8000 at runtime. String expressions are evaluated against a dictionary containing the keys group_name, host_node_name, program_name, process_num, numprocs, here (the directory of the supervisord config file), and all supervisord’s environment variables prefixed with ENV_. Controlled programs should themselves not be daemons, as supervisord assumes it is responsible for daemonizing its subprocesses (see Nondaemonizing of Subprocesses). The command will be truncated if it looks like a config file comment, e.g. command=bash -c 'foo ; bar' will be truncated to command=bash -c 'foo.
