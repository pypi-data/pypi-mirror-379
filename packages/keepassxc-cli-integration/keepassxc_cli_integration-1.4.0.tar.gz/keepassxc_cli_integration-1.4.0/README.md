# Python

--- 

The keepassxc_cli_integration.kpx module provides similar functions for use directly in Python.

---

*Notes:*
- **KeepassXC-GUI !!!MUST!!! have browser integration enabled.**
- *The association is carried out only with the active (and not with all open) databases. In order to receive information from all open databases, you must first carry out an association with each of them.*
- *Intended for Windows. May or may not work on Linux.*
- *Due to limitations of KeepassXC-GUI, it is possible to retrieve records from databases only by URL. The URL field **can be** written in the database without http(s):\\ and **can** also be specified without http(s):\\ in CLI\Python to retrieve data.*

# Installation

1. pip / pipx
```
pip (or pipx) install keepassxc-cli-integration
```
2. git
```
git clone https://github.com/overgodofchaos/keepassxc_cli_integration.git
cd keepassxc-cli-integration
pip (or pipx) install .
```

---

# Examples

---

The query in `kpx run` has the following format:
`@kpx::{{url}}::{{login or password}}::{{name(optional)}}@kpx`
```shell
kpx run poetry publish --build --username=__token__ --password=@kpx::pypi.org::password::pypi_token@kpx
```
 This is mostly for CMD, as there is no convenient way to get the result from third-party functions.


Can be used in scripts:

example.ps1
```powershell
$VeraCrypt = "C:\Program Files\VeraCrypt\VeraCrypt.exe"
$password = kpx get passoword example-vault

& $VeraCrypt /volume "C:\example\vault.hc" /letter Y /password $password /b /q
```
example2.ps1
```powershell
$VeraCrypt = "C:\Program Files\VeraCrypt\VeraCrypt.exe"

kpx run $VeraCrypt /volume "C:\example\vault.hc" /letter Y /password $(kpx get passoword example-vault) /b /q
```
exemple3.bat
```bat
set VeraCrypt="C:\Program Files\VeraCrypt\VeraCrypt.exe"

VeraCrypt /volume "C:\example\vault.hc" /letter Y /password '@kpx::example-vault::password@kpx' /b /q
```
