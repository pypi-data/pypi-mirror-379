Reference implementation of the copan:CORE World-Earth modelling framework.

## Overview

pycopancore is a Python implementation of the copan:CORE modeling framework for building World-Earth (global social-ecological) models. The framework allows easy implementation of complex models by combining different environmental, social-metabolic, and cultural submodels using various modeling techniques including differential equations, stochastic and deterministic events.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pycopancore
```

### Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available at: https://pik-copan.github.io/pycopancore

See [examples](./examples/) for examples on how to use the framework.
