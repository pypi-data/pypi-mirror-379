Stochasticity, noise
====================

*   continuous model components involve
    no noise yet (but may later)
    and are represented by
    *ordinary*
    differential equations (that may later be changed to stochastic diff. eq.)



*   the
    *timing*
    of the events of each type is either

    *   deterministic and regular (e.g. for representation of yearly cycles)



    *   stochastic and irregular, represented by a Poisson process having as parameter a certain
        *event rate*
        specific to the event type





*   most events should be modelled as stochastic and irregular since that makes it easier to experiment with hugely different rates and rate ratios (which has been shown to usually have large impacts on the results)



*   some events will involve additional stochasticity, e.g.

    *   selection of a random link, node or neighbour



    *   drawing an event
        *strength*
        (e.g. for economic crises) from some distribution
