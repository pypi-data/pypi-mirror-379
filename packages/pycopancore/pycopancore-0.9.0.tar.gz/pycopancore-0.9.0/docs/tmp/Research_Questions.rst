Research Questions
==================

A list of

questions we want answer / study with this model:

*   Under which conditions can great acceleration-like dynamics be observed?



*   What are the preconditions for existence and resilience of safe and just operating spaces for humanity (SAJOS)?



*   Connection to SDG process and discourse: how do planetary boundaries and social foundations interact to create the SAJOS? In other words, what are the interdependencies between PBs and social foundations?



*   What is the resilience of future development pathways, particularly the resilience of transformative paths leading to the SAJOS? (resilience in the sense of robustness to perturbations, [constrained] basin stability)



*   What is the role of natural and social tipping elements and their interactions? (DOMINOES Project)



*   Do different non-trivial classes of social-ecological structures emerge, e.g., qualitatively different types of SAJOS?



*   How do the future pathways generated by the CORE model compare to IAM pathways and ESM (climate model) simulations?



*   How do socio-economic inequalities emerge and evolve over time? How does the resource access and availability influence this process?



*   Which management options are able to induce a great transformation (e.g. by directing investments, incentivising sustainable consumption, efficiency policies, â€¦)?



*   Does a great acceleration imply an increasing connectedness in the model?
