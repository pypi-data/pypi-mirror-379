copan:CORE model design

NEWS: Jobst added a software implementation concept based on last week’s discussions!


Suggested procedure:

*   Everyone uses
    *track changes / “Vorschlagen”*
    mode and comments to suggest additions, deletions or modifications



*   DO NOT REJECT suggestions of others here before they were discussed!



*   In modeling meetings, the design team discusses them and accepts or rejects the changes!



*   Before editing, please make sure by reading the
    *whole*
    document that you edit at the right position in the document!



*   Use rather more than less structure by headlines and bullet point hierarchies



*   The document structure was chosen pragmatically but was given some thought, so please let’s
    *not*
    debate too much about the document structure but focus on the contents!



*   Use italics for key concepts and newly defined terms (as in math texts)




The first draft of this document was assembled by Jobst based on his understanding of what we agreed to tentatively.


At some later point when track changes/comments are getting less frequent and formulae get more mathematically involved, we should migrate the document to Overleaf.
