Tutorials by role
=================

We have tutorials for each of the different types of people that can be involved in one way or another with pycopancore:

- *model end users* who apply a composed model to a research question,
- *model composers* who build a model from model components, to be used by end users,
- *model component developers* who design and implement components to be used by composers,
- *modeling_board_members* who maintain consistency across models and components and take care of the master data model, and
- *framework developers* who design, implement and maintain the underlying pycopancore framework itself.
