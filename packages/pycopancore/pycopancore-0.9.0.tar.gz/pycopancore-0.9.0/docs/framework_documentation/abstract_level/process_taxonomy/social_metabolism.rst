Process taxon "Social Metabolism"
=================================

The *social metabolism* 
(also simply called *metabolism* here since no confusion with biological metabolisms is likely)
process taxon is meant to consist of the processes from
material subsystems with non-negligible human-targeted physical imprints
(e.g., "harvesting", "afforestation", "emissions", "waste dumping", "land-use change", "infrastructure building", ...)
and those of their parameters which cannot easily be attached to specific entity-types
(e.g. a globally constant "carbon content of fossil fuels" coefficient).
We expect most social-metabolic processes to deal primarily with the entity-types 
:doc:`"social system"<../entity_types/social system>` (e.g., processes described at national or urban level),
:doc:`"cell"<../entity_types/cell>` 
("local" social-metabolic processes described with additional spatial resolution for easier coupling to environmental processes)
and :doc:`"world"<../entity_types/world>` ("global" social-metabolic processes such as international trade),
and only rarely with the entity-types
:doc:`"firm"<../entity_types/firm>`,
:doc:`"household"<../entity_types/household>`, 
or even :doc:`"individual"<../entity_types/individual>` (micro-economic models).
