Taxonomy of processes
=====================

Based on [Donges2016], 
we classify processes into three major *taxons*:
:doc:`environment<environment>`,
:doc:`social metabolism<social_metabolism>`,
and :doc:`culture<culture>`.

We give only a rough definition and abstain from defining a finer, hierarchical taxonomy,
being aware that gaining consensus among different disciplines on such a taxonomy would be unlikely,
and thus leaving the assignment of individual processes and attributes to either taxon to the respective model component developers:

.. TODO: Make the following definitions a little more accessible by changing the wording? Relate more clearly to the figure and add our own figure.
