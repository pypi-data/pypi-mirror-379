Process taxon "Culture"
=======================

The *culture* process taxon is meant to consist of all processes from immaterial subsystems
(e.g., "opinion adoption", "learning", "voting", ...)
and those of their parameters which cannot easily be attached to specific entity-types.
We expect most cultural processes to deal primarily with the entity-types 
:doc:`"individual"<../entity_types/individual>` (processes described at a "micro" level),
:doc:`"social system"<../entity_types/social system>` (processes described at a "macro" level, typically national or urban),
and :doc:`"group"<../entity_types/group>` (processes described at a "macro" level with social stratification),
and rarely :doc:`"world"<../entity_types/world>` (international processes such as "diplomacy").
