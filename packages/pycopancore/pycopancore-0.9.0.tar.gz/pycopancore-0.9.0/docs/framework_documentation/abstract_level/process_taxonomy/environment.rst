Process taxon "Environment"
===========================

The *environment* process taxon is meant to consist of the processes from 
material subsystems of the Earth system that have no or only negligible human-targeted physical imprints
(e.g., "ocean-athmosphere diffusion", "growth of unmanaged vegetation", and maybe "decay of former waste dumps")
and those of their parameters which cannot easily be attached to specific entity-types
(e.g. a globally constant "diffusion coefficient").
We expect most environmental processes to deal primarily with the entity-types 
:doc:`"cell"<../entity_types/cell>` ("local" processes described with spatial resolution)
and :doc:`"world"<../entity_types/world>` ("global" processes described without spatial resolution)
and sometimes :doc:`"social system"<../entity_types/social system>` 
("mesoscopic" processes described at the level of a social system's territory).
