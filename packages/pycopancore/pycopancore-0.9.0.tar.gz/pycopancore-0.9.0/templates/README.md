# Model end users
Use the `studies/run.py` template and use an existing model from the framework.

# Model developers 
In addition to the above use the `models/model.py` template to compose a model
from existing components provided by the framework. 

# Model component developers
In addition to the above, use the `model_components/` template folder and
design own components in there. If you wish to develop more than one model
duplicate the folder `one_component` and create a second or more components.
