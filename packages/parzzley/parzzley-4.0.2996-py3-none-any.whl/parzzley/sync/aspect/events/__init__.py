Aspect events are part of the plug-in mechanism that encapsulates its behavior in aspects.

In the course of a sync run, the Parzzley engine will trigger those events in a particular order. Aspects implement
various parts of Parzzley functionality by handling some of those events (while the engine itself does not much more
than triggering these events).

The Parzzley documentation also contains an overview of aspect events and how they actually perform their duty of
filesystem synchronization.
