## 📌 Overview  
**LMMH Library** is a comprehensive AI framework that brings together powerful tools for:  

1. **🗨️ Chat & Text AI** – Natural Language Processing, chatbots, embeddings, summarization, and intelligent assistants.  
2. **👁️ Vision AI Processing** – Computer vision utilities for image recognition, classification, detection, and preprocessing.  

Whether you are building conversational agents, text analysis pipelines, or advanced computer vision applications, **LMMH Library** provides a modular and scalable foundation.

## 🛠️ How This Library Was Made  
The **LMMH Library** was created with the vision of providing a **unified framework** for two of the most important domains of Artificial Intelligence:  

- **Chat/Text AI**: Inspired by the rise of LLMs (Large Language Models) and modern NLP techniques, this module integrates natural language understanding, text generation, embeddings, and chatbot frameworks into a single, easy-to-use package.  

- **Vision AI Processing**: Leveraging computer vision research, this module combines classical image processing techniques with modern deep learning models, making it easy to perform image classification, object detection, and preprocessing tasks.  

The library is built in **Python**, designed to be lightweight but powerful, and packaged for distribution via **PyPI** so anyone can install and use it.  

Development was guided by the following principles:  
- **Accessibility** – Easy for beginners to get started.  
- **Scalability** – Flexible enough for advanced research and production.  
- **Modularity** – Each AI domain (Chat/Text, Vision) is self-contained but interoperable.  
- **Community-driven** – Open to contributions and improvements.
