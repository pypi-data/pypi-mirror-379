2. Click "New Token"
3. Copy the generated token

3. Copy the budget_id part

### Account ID (Optional)
1. Click on a specific account in YNAB

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with uvx (no installation needed)
uvx ynab-amazon-categorizer

# Or if installed as a tool
ynab-amazon-categorizer

# Or run as a Python module
python -m ynab_amazon_categorizer
```

### Workflow
1. **Provide Amazon Orders Data** (optional but recommended):
   - Copy your Amazon orders page content
     - For example go to https://www.amazon.ca/gp/css/order-history?ref_=nav_orders_first and select all and copy the text
   - Run the tool and paste Amazon order info when prompted 
   - The script will automatically match transactions with orders

2. **Review Matched Transactions**:
   - The script shows order details, items, and links before asking to categorize
   - For multiple items, it suggests splitting the transaction

3. **Categorize Transactions**:
   - Use tab completion to select categories
   - Accept suggested memos or customize them
   - Confirm updates with enhanced previews

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Tab**: Auto-complete category names
- **Enter**: Accept defaults (categorize, use suggested memo, confirm update)
- **Alt+Enter**: Submit multiline input (Amazon orders data, custom memos)
- **Ctrl+C**: Cancel current operation

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control!

- The script loads credentials from environment variables or config file
- Your API key is never hardcoded in the script
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` if using git

## Troubleshooting

### "No orders could be parsed"
- Make sure you're copying the full Amazon orders page content
- Try copying from a different browser or clearing browser cache

### "API Key not found"
- Verify your `.env` file exists and has the correct format
- Check that your API key is valid in YNAB Developer Settings

### "No transactions found"
- Ensure you have uncategorized Amazon transactions in YNAB
- Check that the payee names contain "amazon", "amzn", or "amz"

### Emoji display issues
- Use `python -X utf8` on Windows for proper emoji support
- Ensure your terminal supports UTF-8 encoding
