## graphs_wendyhielo

    A lightweight Python package for working with weighted graphs, centered on Dijkstra's shortest path. 

# What it does:
    * computes single-source shortest paths on weighted, directed graphs (non-negative weights) using a min-heap-based Dijkstra implementation. 
    * Returns a distance list with the minimum cost from the source to each vertex and a path map that lets you reconstruct shortest paths. 

# How it works:
    *The graph is represented as an adjacency map (each vertex maps to a dictionary of neighbors → edge weights).
    *A min-heap stores candidate vertices keyed by their best-known distance from the source.
    *Distances initialize to “infinity” except the source (zero). The algorithm relaxes edges until the heap is empty.

# Installation (no code)
    1. Clone this public repository to your machine.

    2. From the project root, install the package with your standard Python package manager (e.g., pip).
    
    3. After installation, the package is importable as graphs_wendyhielo, and the shortest-path functions are available in its sp module.
