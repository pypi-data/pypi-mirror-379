# `annular` developer documentation

If you're looking for user documentation, go [here](README.md).

## Development install

```shell
# Create a virtual environment, e.g. with
python -m venv .venv

# activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# make sure to have a recent version of pip and setuptools
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# (from the project root directory)
# install annular as an editable package
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --editable .
# install development dependencies
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --editable .[dev]
```

Afterwards check that the install directory is present in the `PATH` environment variable.

## Running the tests

There are two ways to run tests.

The first way requires an activated virtual environment with the development tools installed:

```shell
pytest -v
```

The second is to use `tox`, which can be installed separately (e.g. with `pip install tox`), i.e. not necessarily inside the virtual environment you use for installing `annular`, but then builds the necessary virtual environments itself by simply running:

```shell
tox
```

Testing with `tox` allows for keeping the testing environment separate from your development environment.
The development environment will typically accumulate (old) packages during development that interfere with testing; this problem is avoided by testing with `tox`.

### Test coverage

In addition to just running the tests to see if they pass, they can be used for coverage statistics, i.e. to determine how much of the package's code is actually executed during tests.
In an activated virtual environment with the development tools installed, inside the package directory, run:

```shell
coverage run
```

This runs tests and stores the result in a `.coverage` file.
To see the results on the command line, run

```shell
coverage report
```

`coverage` can also generate output in HTML and other formats; see `coverage help` for more information.

### Running tests in parallel

While most of the (unit) tests are fairly short, some of the integration tests take longer to run.
To speed this up, we can run some of our tests in parallel using the `pytest-xdist` plugin.
A practical consideration is that the main integration tests require running MUSCLE3, which cannot
easily be run in parallel. As such, these tests have a special `pytest.mark.xdist_group("muscle3")"`
mark attached to them. By using the special `--dist loadgroup` flag, these tests are guaranteed to
run on the same worker and not conflict with each other, while the rest of the tests can still be
run in parallel, without encountering errors due to parallelization.

So, to safely run the tests in parallel, you can use the following command:
```shell
pytest -n 3 --dist loadgroup  # use 3 workers in parallel```


## Running linters locally

For linting and sorting imports we use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/). Running the linters requires an
activated virtual environment with the development tools installed.

```shell
# linter
ruff .

# linter with automatic fixing
ruff . --fix
```

To fix readability of your code style you can use [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf).

We recommend running [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) before each commit.
You can enable pre-commit to run automatically by running [`pre-commit install`](https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts),
assuming you already have the development install of this package.

## Generating the API docs

```shell
cd docs
make html
```

The documentation will be in `docs/_build/html`

If you do not have `make` use

```shell
sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html
```

To find undocumented Python objects run

```shell
cd docs
make coverage
cat _build/coverage/python.txt
```

To [test snippets](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html) in documentation run

```shell
cd docs
make doctest
```

## Versioning

Bumping the version across all files is done with [bump-my-version](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version), e.g.

```shell
bump-my-version major  # bumps from e.g. 0.3.2 to 1.0.0
bump-my-version minor  # bumps from e.g. 0.3.2 to 0.4.0
bump-my-version patch  # bumps from e.g. 0.3.2 to 0.3.3
```

## Making a release

This section describes how to make a release in 2 parts:

1. preparation
1. making a release on GitLab

### (1/2) Preparation

1. Update the <CHANGELOG.md> (don't forget to update links at bottom of page)
2. Verify that the information in [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff) is correct.
3. Make sure the [version has been updated](#versioning).
4. Run the unit tests with `pytest -v`


### (2/2) GitLab

Don't forget to also make a [release on GitLab](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/demoses/annular/-/releases/new).
Once your release is ready, be sure to upload the new version to Zenodo too.
