# Material composition source: same as density

# Material name:
# polystyrene (PS)

# Number of elements:
2

# Density:
1.000000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.077426    # hydrogen
6    0.922574    # carbon

# Note: There are multiple types of polystyrene. For a specific material (e.g. for foam), a new file can be made by revising the density.
