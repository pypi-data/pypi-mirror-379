# Density souce: unknown - legacy material specification
# Material composition source: same as density

# Material name:
# brass

# Number of elements:
2

# Density:
8.5

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
29    0.60    # copper
30    0.40    # zinc

# Note: there are multiple brass alloys. This is a simple example.
