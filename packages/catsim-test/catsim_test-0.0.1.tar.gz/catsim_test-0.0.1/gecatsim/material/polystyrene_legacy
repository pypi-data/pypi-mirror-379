# Material name:
# polystyrene_legacy

# Number of elements:
2

# Density:
1.060
	
# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.077421    # hydrogen
6    0.922579    # carbon

# Note: this is a legacy material specification and is included for those who may want to repeat prior experiments that used it.
# There are multiple types of polystyrene. The density used here is higher than found for solid polystyrene.
# For new work, polystyrene (for solid) or a specification of your design (e.g. for foam) may be preferred.
