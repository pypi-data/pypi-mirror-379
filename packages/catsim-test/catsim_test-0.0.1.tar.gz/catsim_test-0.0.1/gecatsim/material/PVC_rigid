# Density source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride
# Material composition source: same as density

# Material name:
# polyvinylchloride (PVC), rigid

# Number of elements:
3

# Density:
1.370000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.048385    # hydrogen
6    0.384360    # carbon
17    0.567255    # chlorine

# There are multiple types of PVC. The density used here is mid-range for rigid PVC.
# A specification of your design may be preferred, by revising the density to reflex a specific product.
