# iblatlas
Tools to manipulate hierarchical 3D representations of the mouse brain anatomy for electrophysiolgy experiments.
The tools are mainly using the Allen CCF although some other atlases can be used.

**This repository uses minimal requirements, based of standard `matplotlib`, `numpy` and `scipy` libraries, to the exclusion
of more complex visualization tools such as `pyqt`.**
