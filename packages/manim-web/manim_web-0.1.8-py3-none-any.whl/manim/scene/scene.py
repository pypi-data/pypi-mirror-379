class Scene:
    """A Scene is the canvas of your animation.

    The primary role of :class:`Scene` is to provide the user with tools to manage
    mobjects and animations.  Generally speaking, a manim script consists of a class
    that derives from :class:`Scene` whose :meth:`Scene.construct` method is overridden
    by the user's code.

    Mobjects are displayed on screen by calling :meth:`Scene.add` and removed from
    screen by calling :meth:`Scene.remove`.  All mobjects currently on screen are kept
    in :attr:`Scene.mobjects`.  Animations are played by calling :meth:`Scene.play`.

    A :class:`Scene` is rendered internally by calling :meth:`Scene.render`.  This in
    turn calls :meth:`Scene.setup`, :meth:`Scene.construct`, and
    :meth:`Scene.tear_down`, in that order.

    It is not recommended to override the ``__init__`` method in user Scenes.  For code
    that should be ran before a Scene is rendered, use :meth:`Scene.setup` instead.

    Examples
    --------
    Override the :meth:`Scene.construct` method with your code.
