  NIRSPEC set of models from slit_frame to GWA.

description: |
  This model is used by the NIRSPEC WCS pipeline.
  It stores transforms from the virrtual slit frame, where (0, 0) 
  is the center of the slit. to the Grating Wheel Assembly (GWA).

          The slit number is computed from the quadrant and
          the slit ID in this quadrant using
