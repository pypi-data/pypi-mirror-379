r'''Provides strongly-typed unique identifiers for entities.

This module offers a base class, [`BaseId`][frequenz.core.id.BaseId], which can be
subclassed to create distinct ID types for different components or concepts within
a system.

These IDs ensure type safety, meaning that an ID for one type of entity (e.g., a
sensor) cannot be mistakenly used where an ID for another type (e.g., a
microgrid) is expected.

# Creating Custom ID Types

To define a new ID type, create a class that inherits from
[`BaseId`][frequenz.core.id.BaseId] and provide a unique `str_prefix` as a keyword
argument in the class definition. This prefix is used in the string representation of
the ID and must be unique across all ID types.

Note:
    The `str_prefix` must be unique across all ID types. If you try to use a
    prefix that is already registered, a `ValueError` will be raised when defining
    the class.

To encourage consistency, the class name must end with the suffix "Id" (e.g.,
`MyNewId`). This check can be bypassed by passing `allow_custom_name=True` when
defining the class (e.g., `class MyCustomName(BaseId, str_prefix="MCN",
allow_custom_name=True):`).

Tip:
    Use the [`@typing.final`][typing.final] decorator to prevent subclassing of
    ID classes.

Example: Creating a standard ID type
    ```python
    from typing import final
    from frequenz.core.id import BaseId

    @final
    class InverterId(BaseId, str_prefix="INV"):
        """A unique identifier for an inverter."""

    inv_id = InverterId(123)
    print(inv_id)       # Output: INV123
    print(int(inv_id))  # Output: 123
    ```

Example: Creating an ID type with a non-standard name
    ```python
    from typing import final
    from frequenz.core.id import BaseId

    @final
    class CustomNameForId(BaseId, str_prefix="CST", allow_custom_name=True):
        """An ID with a custom name, not ending in 'Id'."""

    custom_id = CustomNameForId(456)
    print(custom_id)       # Output: CST456
    print(int(custom_id))  # Output: 456
    ```
