    Tip:
        Normally it is not necessary to use this class directly, use

    Behavior:

    - In the class body, members may be declared as `NAME = DeprecatedMember(value, msg)`.
    - During class creation, these wrappers are replaced with `value` so that
      a normal enum member or alias is created by [`EnumType`][enum.EnumType].
    - The deprecated names are recorded so that:

        * `MyEnum.NAME` warns (attribute access by name)
        * `MyEnum["NAME"]` warns (lookup by name)
        * `MyEnum(value)` warns **only if** the resolved member has **no**
            non-deprecated aliases (all names for that member are deprecated).

        To declare a deprecated member, use the

        the resolved member has no non-deprecated aliases. If there is at least one
        non-deprecated alias for the member, no warning is emitted.

        Example:
