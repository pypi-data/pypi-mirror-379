# QType

**QType is a domain-specific language (DSL) for rapid prototyping of AI applications.**  
It is designed to help developers define modular, composable AI systems using a structured YAML-based specification. QType supports models, prompts, tools, retrievers, and flow orchestration, and is extensible for code generation or live interpretation.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Install QType:

```bash
pip install qtype[interpreter]
```

Create a file `hello_world.qtype.yaml` that answers a question:
```yaml
id: hello_world
flows:
  - id: chat_example
    description: A simple chat flow with OpenAI
    mode: Chat
    steps:
      - id: llm_inference_step
        model: 
          id: gpt-4
          provider: openai
          auth: 
            id: openai_auth
            type: api_key
            api_key: ${OPENAI_KEY}
        system_message: |
          You are a helpful assistant.
        inputs:
          - id: user_message
            type: ChatMessage
        outputs:
          - id: response
            type: ChatMessage
```

Put your openai api key into your `.env` file:
```
echo "OPENAI_KEY=sk...." >> .env
```

Validate it's semantic correctness:

```bash
qtype validate hello_world.qtype.yaml 
```

You should see:

```
INFO: ‚úÖ Schema validation successful.
INFO: ‚úÖ Model validation successful.
INFO: ‚úÖ Language validation successful
INFO: ‚úÖ Semantic validation successful
```

Launch the interpreter:

```bash
qtype serve hello_world.qtype.yaml`
```


And go to [http://localhost:8000/ui](http://localhost:8000/ui) to see the user interface for your application:

## üß† Philosophy

QType is built around modularity, traceability, and rapid iteration. It aims to empower developers to quickly scaffold ideas into usable AI applications without sacrificing maintainability or control.

Stay tuned for upcoming features like:
- Integrated OpenTelemetry tracing
- Validation via LLM-as-a-judge
- UI hinting via input display types
- Flow state switching and conditional routing
