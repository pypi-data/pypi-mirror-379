The market's demo command is used to study the values of a large
batch of activated FRPs. The designated FRPs are activated and a
table summarizing their values is displayed, along with the kind
that all these FRPs share.

The syntax of the command is

  demo _count_ with kind (___).

where _count_ represents a positive integer and the ___ is
filled in by the input format for specifying a kind. 
(See `help kinds` and `help show` for more.) The words 'with' 
and 'kind' are both optional. The command must, as usual, end 
in a period.

The output table shows the distinct values produced by the
batch, the counts of how many FRPs have each value, and
the percentage of the FRPs having each value.

The market will validate the kind tree as you are entering
it. Validation messages are delayed until the ending period
is typed. You will not be able to enter the command until
the validation warnings are resolved. These messags show
where in the command input a problem was discovered.
