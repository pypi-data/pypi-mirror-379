The market's show command is used to display the kind tree
specified by the kind input format. (See `help kinds`.)
The command has syntax

   show kind (___).

where the word `kind` is optional and the ___ is to be
filled with the kind specification. 

This produces a display of the tree as specified,
i.e., not necessarily in canonical form. The tree
is displayed horizontally with the root on the left
and the leaves on the right.
