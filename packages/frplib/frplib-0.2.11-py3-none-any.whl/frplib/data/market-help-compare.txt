The market's compare command is used to examine demos from two
kinds, side-by-side (so to speak). The output is similar to that of
the demo command, but there is a kind display and summary for each
of the specified kinds.

The syntax for the command is

   compare _count_ with kinds (___) and (___).

where _count_ should be replaced with a positive integer, and the __'s
should be replaced by the kind input format. The words 'with',
'kinds', and 'and' are all optional here.
