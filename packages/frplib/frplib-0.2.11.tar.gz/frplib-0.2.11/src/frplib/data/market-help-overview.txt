The FRP market allows you to activate and purchase large
collections of Fixed Random Payoffs and to study the
results of such investments. The goal is to provide
a platform for learning how an FRP's kind connects
with our predictions about an FRP's value.

There are four main commands in the market

- show :: show the kind tree associated with the string
      input format used by the market.

      See `help show` for details on the command
      and `help kinds` for details on the input format.

- demo :: activate batches of FRPs with a fixed kind
      and see a summery of the results.

      See `help demo` for details.

- buy :: purchase and activate batches of FRPs with a fixed kind
      and at various prices. See details on the payoff from
      purchases at each price.

      See `help buy` for details.

- compare :: compare the results of activating the same sized
      batches with two different kinds.

      See `help compare` for details.

All commands can span multiple lines and should end in a period.
Validation information is shown at the bottom of the screen
once you have entered a command's period.

You can use `exit.` or `quit.` to exit the market.
