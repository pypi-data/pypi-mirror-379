# patch-fixer
So you asked an LLM to generate a code diff, tried to apply it with `git apply`, and got a bunch of malformed patch errors? Well fear no more, `patch_fixer.py` is here to save the day... more or less.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ajcm474/patch-fixer.git
cd patch-fixer
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
```
python patch_fixer.py original broken.patch fixed.patch
```
where `original` is the file or directory you were trying to patch, 
`broken.patch` is the malformed patch generated by the LLM, 
and `fixed.patch` is the output file containing the (hopefully) fixed patch.

## Testing
Assuming you've already cloned the repo:
```
pip install -e .[test]
pytest
```
Note that some tests currently fail as this project is in the early alpha stage.
