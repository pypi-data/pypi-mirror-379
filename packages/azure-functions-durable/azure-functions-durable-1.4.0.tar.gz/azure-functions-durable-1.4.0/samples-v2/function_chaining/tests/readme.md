# Durable Functions Sample â€“ Unit Tests (Python)

## Overview

This directory contains a simple **unit test** for the sample [Durable Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview) written in Python. This test demonstrates how to validate the logic of the orchestrator function in isolation using mocks.

Writing unit tests for Durable functions requires sligtly different syntax for accessing the original method definition. Orchestrator functions, client functions, and entity functions all come with their own ways to access the user code: 

### Orchestrator functions
```
my_orchestrator.build().get_user_function().orchestrator_function
```

### Client functions
```
my_client_function.build().get_user_function().client_function
```

### Entity functions
```
my_entity_function.build().get_user_function().entity_function
```

This sample app demonstrates using these accessors to get and test Durable functions. It also demonstrates how to mock the calling behavior that Durable uses to run orchestrators during replay with the orchestrator_generator_wrapper method defined in test_my_orchestrator.py and simulates the Tasks yielded by DurableOrchestrationContext with MockTask objects in the same file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) (for running functions locally)  
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for test execution  
- VS Code with the **Python** and **Azure Functions** extensions (optional but recommended)

## Running Tests from the Command Line

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project root (where your `requirements.txt` is).
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest 
```

## Running Tests in Visual Studio Code
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Make sure the Python extension is installed.
3. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), then select:
```
Python: Configure Tests
```
4. Choose pytest as the test framework.
5. Point to the tests/ folder when prompted.
6. Once configured, run tests from the Test Explorer panel or inline with the test code.

Notes
- Tests use mocks to simulate Durable Functions' context objects.
- These are unit tests only; no real Azure services are called.
- For integration tests, consider starting the host with func start.
