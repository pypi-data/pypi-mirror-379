        The orchestrator function can exhibit any combination of the following behaviors:
        - Execute regular code and return a value or raise an exception
        - Invoke get_activity_call_result or get_activity_call_result_with_retry, which leads to
          either interrupting the orchestrator function immediately (because of YieldException),
          or queueing the task for later yielding while continuing execution
        - Invoke DurableAIAgentContext.call_activity or call_activity_with_retry (which must lead
          to corresponding record_activity_call invocations)
        - Yield tasks (typically produced by DurableAIAgentContext methods like call_activity,
          wait_for_external_event, etc.), which may or may not interrupt orchestrator function
          execution
        - Mix all of the above in any combination

        This method converts both YieldException and regular yields into a sequence of yields
        preserving the order, while also capturing return values through the generator protocol.
        For example, if the orchestrator function yields task A, then queues task B for yielding,
        then raises YieldException wrapping task C, this method makes sure that the resulting
        sequence of yields is: (A, B, C).
