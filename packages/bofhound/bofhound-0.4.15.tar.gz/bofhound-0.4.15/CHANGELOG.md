## [0.4.3] - 10/30/2024
### Added
- Support for pasing ldapsearch BOF results within Havoc log files

### Changed
- Parsers now can inherit from the `LdapSearchBofParser` (since support for other C2s usually still relies on the same BOF) to cut down on code copypasta
- The `GenericParser` class (used to parse local group memberships, session data) is now called from main parsers (`LdapSearchBofParser`, `HavocParser`, etc.) to prevent each logfile from being opened, read, formatted, and parsed twice (each file is now read once and just parsed twice, once for LDAP objects and once for local objects)

## [0.4.2] - 10/24/2024

    - `Standard` to closely mirror object attributes shown by SharpHound/BHCE
    - `Member` to include `member` and `memberOf` properties (and a few others)
    - `All` to include all properties parsed by bofhound

## [0.3.1] - 1/25/2024

- GPO JSON file not matching JSON definition for BHCE
    - `domainsid` property gets set on all GPO objects now (requires domain objects to be queried)

## [0.2.0] - 03/28/2023
### Added
- New parser to support parsing LDAP Sentinel data from BRc4 logs

### Changed
- Modified logic for how group memberships are determined
    - Prior method was iterate through DNs in groups' `member` attribute and adding objects with matching DNs
    - Since BRc4 does not store DNs in the `member` attibute, added iteration over objects' `memberOf` attribute and add to groups with matching DN (i.e. membership is now calculated from both sides of relationship)
