"""
Replace Merge Strategy

This strategy merges files by completely replacing the result with the
last file's data. This is useful when you want to use files as a chain
of overrides, where each file completely replaces the previous one.

Key Features:
- Complete replacement with last file
- Simple and predictable behavior
- Useful for override chains
- Minimal processing overhead

Example:
    >>> from yapfm.multi_file.strategies import ReplaceMergeStrategy
    >>>
    >>> strategy = ReplaceMergeStrategy()
    >>> result = strategy.merge([
    ...     (Path("base.json"), {"a": 1, "b": 2}),
    ...     (Path("override.json"), {"c": 3, "d": 4})
    ... ])
    >>> # Result: {"c": 3, "d": 4}
