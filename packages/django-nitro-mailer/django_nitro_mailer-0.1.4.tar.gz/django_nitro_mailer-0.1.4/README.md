## Overview

`django-nitro-mailer` is a pluggable Django app that provides extra email reliability and observability in form of email backends that can be used with Django's built-in functions and other email backend.

`django-nitro-mailer` by itself does not provide a way to send emails, but it puts an extra layer before the email backend to provide extra features like:

* priority queueing
* retrying failed emails
* logging and traces
* email throttling
* sending messages through the admin panel

## Requirements

* Python >= 3.11, < 3.14
* Django >= 4.2, < 5.2

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
$ pip install django-nitro-mailer
```

## Usage

1. Add `django_nitro_mailer` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "django_nitro_mailer",
    ...
]
```

2. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the necessary tables.

3. Change the `EMAIL_BACKEND` setting in your `settings.py` to use the desired backend:

* **Database Backend**: Store emails in the database and send them asynchronously. Requires sending a cron job or some other scheduled task to send the emails.

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django_nitro_mailer.backends.DatabaseBackend"
```

* **Sync Backend**: Send emails synchronously. Does not provide the reliability that the database backend provides, but still provides the logging and throttling features.

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django_nitro_mailer.backends.SyncBackend"
```
