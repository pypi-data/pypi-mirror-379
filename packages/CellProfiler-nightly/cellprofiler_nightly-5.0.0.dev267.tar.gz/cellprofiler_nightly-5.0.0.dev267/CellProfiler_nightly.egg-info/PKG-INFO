# frontend

This codebase contains the code to build the `cellprofiler` package. It contains modules that implement the GUI interface, the CLI interface, and others that are non-essential to the functioning of the [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org) software. The [subpackages](https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler/tree/main/src/subpackages) are necessary dependencies for the functioning of `cellprofiler`.
