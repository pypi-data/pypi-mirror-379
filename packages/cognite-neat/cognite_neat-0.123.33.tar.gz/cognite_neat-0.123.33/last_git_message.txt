[THIS-733] ðŸ¥º Add toolkit http client (#1287)

# Description

This adds an `HTTPClient` to Neat. 

Why do we need an `HTTPClient` in Neat? Can't we just use the
`cognite-sdk` client?

* **Performance**. This client uses `httpx` instead of `requests` which
is faster and more modern. In addition, Neat has pydantic classes for
all data modeling components. Pydantic has the serialization written in
rust, which is much faster than having to go via the cognite-sdk data
classes. Finally, the `cognite-sdk` limits max-workers to 1 when working
with data modeling, this is first step towards allowing concurrent reads
and writes to data modeling using neat.
* **Error handling**: Neat needs to handle errors in the deployment of
data models, for example, being able to split items into multiple
requests requests if it returns a 400. If we built on the `cognite-sdk`
we do not get low level control over the responses.

**Risk-Reviewer**: This is a copy-paste form the Toolkit code base that
has already been through risk-review. It is not yet adapted for Neat.
This is such that this can be approved without a new review as this has
already been reviewed in the Toolkit code base.
