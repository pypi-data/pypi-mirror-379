Refactoring Data Model: Adding neat specific URI and NameSpace classes (#1280)

# Description

This is first of a number of PR that are focused on refactoring neat
data model features to be exposed as Toolkit plugin. In this specific PR
previously neat own `Uri` and `NameSpace` class is defined, such that
`rdflib` package can be made into an optional dependency. Notice that
`_constants.py` is copied from
`cognite/neat/core/_data_model/models/entities`.

## Bump

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Added

- Added neat native `URI` and `NameSpace` classes that behave same as
those provided by `rdflib` package
