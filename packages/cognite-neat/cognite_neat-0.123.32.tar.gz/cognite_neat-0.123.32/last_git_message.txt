THIS-738: Fix case sensitivity issue in direction definitions (#1290)

# Description

Up until now we were case-sensitive when providing input for edge
directionality , which had to be specified in lower case as either
`inwards` or `outwards`. With this PR we are fixing this issue, i.e.
being case-insensitive.

## Bump

- [X] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Improved

- No more case-sensitive input needed for edge definition of
directionality
