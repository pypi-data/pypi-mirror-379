`uvnote` is a computational document system that allows you to create reproducible, shareable, and interactive documents using plain Markdown and [uv/PEP 723](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#running-scripts) scripts.

In other words, its a alternative for Jupyter notebooks that is more lightweight, more reproducible, and more portable.

`uvnote` is kinda like a combination of a Markdown file and a Jupyter notebook and a static site generator.

## Concept

The premise is simple:

- you write normal markdown files with python code blocks
- each code block is expanded to a [uv/PEP 723 script](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#running-scripts)
- the output of each script is capture and rendered in the markdown file.
- all data/scripts are hashed and cached (in `.uvnote/cache`) so everything can be inspected and intelligently re-run when needed.
- no magic runtimes (relies on uv)
- no hidden state (cells are not stateful, they are just scripts)
- no special file formats (just plain markdown)

## Cool features

okay, so the core concept is simple (embed uv scripts in markdown), but there are some cool features that make `uvnote` more powerful than just that!

- interactive auto fading drawing tools to help present the note to others in an engaging way
- automatically generate a table of contents/links artifacts for easy navigation
- light/dark mode
- simplify syntax for dependencies (e.g. `deps=numpy,pandas` in code block header will be expanded to the PEP 723 metadata)
- and again NO MAGIC, so if you want to change css or add custom HTML you can easily do that.

## How to use

Currently, the recommended way to use `uvnote` is to directly run the script from GitHub using `uvx`, this will download and run the latest version of `uvnote` without needing to install anything until we have a proper release.


### Check version

```bash
uvx uvnote --version
# uvnote, version 0.3.1
```

### Create a new uvnote file

```bash
uvx uvnote init --name mynote.md
# Created mynote.md
```

### Compile the uvnote file to HTML

```bash
uvx uvnote build mynote.md

# 13:21:10 - INFO -   status=complete
# Generated: site/mynote.html
# Copied cell files to: site/cells
```

### Open the generated HTML file

```bash
open site/mynote.html
```


## Commands

```bash
uvx uvnote --help
```

outputs

```text
Usage: uvnote [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  uvnote: Stateless, deterministic notebooks with uv and Markdown.

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build          Build static HTML from markdown file.
  build-loading  Build HTML with loading placeholders for stale cells.
  cache-prune    Prune cache to target size using LRU eviction.
  clean          Clear cache and site files.
  export         Export cell files and their dependencies to a directory.
  graph          Show dependency graph for markdown file.
  run            Run cells from markdown file.
  serve          Watch markdown file, rebuild on changes, and serve HTML...
```

### Frontmatter options

You can specify some options in the frontmatter of the markdown file to customize the behavior of `uvnote`.

```markdown
---
title: My Note
author: you
theme: dark | light
syntax_theme: monokai
ui_theme: default | monocolor
show_line_numbers: true | false
---
```

### Code block options

You can specify some options in the code block header to customize the behavior of each code block.

```markdown
\`\`\`python id=unique_id deps=numpy,pandas collapse-code=true
# your code here
\`\`\`
```

- `id`: A unique identifier for the code block. If not provided, a hash of the code will be used.
- `deps`: A comma-separated list of dependencies to install for the code block. These will
- `depends`: A comma-separated list of other code block ids that this code block depends on. This will ensure that the dependent code blocks are run before this one.
- `collapse-code`: If true, the code block will be collapsed by default in the rendered HTML.
- `collapse-output`: If true, the output of the code block will be collapsed by default in the rendered HTML.


## Experimental features

We support a `serve` command that will watch the markdown file for changes and automatically rebuild and serve the HTML file with live reloading. This works in most cases but can be a bit buggy when cell execution takes a long time and cannot be easily cancelled.
