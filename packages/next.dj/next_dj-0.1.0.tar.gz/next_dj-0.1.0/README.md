## What is `next.dj`?

`next.dj` is a modern framework based on Django that provides a unique opportunity - you can build full-stack applications on Django! Now you don't need frontend developers on React or other frameworks. It simplifies Django development by providing intuitive APIs and automatic code generation, offering a file-based routing system similar to Next.js, but built on top of Django's robust ecosystem.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! `next.dj` is designed to make Django development more accessible to frontend developers, and your input is invaluable.
