The **Vior Secrets SDK** provides a secure, cross-platform way to manage, store, and retrieve your secrets.
It works consistently on **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**.

---

## Installation

### Linux & Windows

The installation process is the same for Linux and Windows. Install directly using pip:

```bash
pip install vior-cli
```

---

### macOS

On macOS, we recommend installing via **pipx** for isolation and easy upgrades.
If you donâ€™t already have Homebrew and pipx installed, run:

```bash
# Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install pipx with Homebrew
brew install pipx

# Ensure pipx is added to your PATH
pipx ensurepath

# Install vior-cli with pipx
pipx install vior-cli
```
