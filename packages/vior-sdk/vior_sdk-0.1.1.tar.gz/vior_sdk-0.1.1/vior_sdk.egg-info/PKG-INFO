# Vior Secrets SDK (v0.1.0)

The **Vior Secrets SDK** provides a secure, cross-platform way to manage, store, and retrieve your secrets.
It works consistently on **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**.

---

## Installation

### Linux & Windows

The installation process is the same for Linux and Windows. Install directly using pip:

```bash
pip install vior-cli
```

---

### macOS

On macOS, we recommend installing via **pipx** for isolation and easy upgrades.
If you donâ€™t already have Homebrew and pipx installed, run:

```bash
# Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install pipx with Homebrew
brew install pipx

# Ensure pipx is added to your PATH
pipx ensurepath

# Install vior-cli with pipx
pipx install vior-cli
```

---

## Configuration

After installation, configure your credentials:

```bash
vior configure
```

You can obtain your credentials from the **Vior Secrets Console**:
[https://secrets.viorcloud.com](https://secrets.viorcloud.com)

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the documentation:
[https://secrets.viorcloud.com/docs](https://secrets.viorcloud.com/docs)

## Usage Examples

Store a new secret:

```bash
vior secrets put my-db-password "supersecret123"
```

Retrieve a secret:

```bash
vior secrets get my-db-password
```

List all secrets:

```bash
vior secrets list
```

Delete a secret:

```bash
vior secrets delete my-db-password
```
