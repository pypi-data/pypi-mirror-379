# Agent developer scratchpad

> [!NOTE]  
> By default, we don't collect any data from you. There is code for telemetry which we exclusively use for dedicated test users. (We don't distribute the DB connection url/key with the repo)

See README's in src dirs for more details.

## User workflow
We assume the user coded their workflow in Python, i.e., runs it with something like:

 - `python -m foo.bar`
 - `ENV_VAR=5 python script.py --some-flag`

All they change is the Python command. Whenever they want to develop their script with us, they run:

 - `aco-launch -m foo.bar`
 - `ENV_VAR=5 aco-launch script.py --some-flag`

This will feel *exactly* the same as running Python but also analyzes their code, populates our VS Code extension, etc. Specfically:

 - Program prints/reads to/from same terminal, crashes the same, etc.
 - [User can use VS Code debugger](https://github.com/ferdiko/agent-copilot/blob/9af2cbc27fef1e6a0a6bb63c7ad678cf04cdb205/.vscode/launch.json#L11)

## Getting started
### Installation
If you're starting from a clean sheet, create a blank conda environment and activate it. We recommend Python 3.13, but Python versions >=3.10 are supported.
```bash
conda create -n aco python=3.13 -y && conda activate aco
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are a developer of this project, jump to the [Development](#development) section for installation instructions.

For non-developers, install the project like so:
```bash
pip install -e .
# Because the extension is not packaged yet, you need to install UI dependencies as well
cd src/user_interface && npm install
```

### Running the extension
Open this project in a new window. Select the "Run Extension" option from the debugger and run it. This will open a new window with the extension enabled ([more details](/src/user_interface/README.md)).

### Try an example
In the new window, you can now open any project that you are working on. We will run an example from our [examples](./example_workflows/debug_examples/) folder. Note that this example depends on the OpenAI API.
```bash
aco-launch ./example_workflows/debug_examples/openai_add_numbers.py
```

## Development

Please install the dependencies required for developing
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
cd src/user_interface && npm install
```

### Server commands and log
To manually start and stop our server. Just do:

 - `aco-server start`
 - `aco-server stop`

If you make changes to the server code, you can also do `aco-server restart` so the changes are reflected in the running server. If you want to clear all recorded runs and cached LLM calls, do `aco-server clear`.

If the server isn't running already, it will automatically be started upon running `aco-launch`.

The server logs can be found in `~/.cache/agent-copilot/logs/server.log`.

### Architecture

These are the processes running. 

1. Run user program (green): The users launch processes of their program by running `aco-launch their_script.py` which feels exactly like running their script normally with `python their_script.py` --- they can also use the debugger to run their script, which also feels completely normal. Under the hood the `aco-launch` command monkey patches certain functions and logs runtime events to the `develop server`. The `develop runner` runs the actual python program of the user. The `develop orchestrator` manages the life cycle of the runner. For example, when the user presses the restart button in the UI, the orchestrator with kill the current runner and re-launch it. [Code](src/runner/)
2. Develop server (blue): The `develop server` is the core of the system and responsbible for all analysis. It receives the logs from the user process and updates the UI according to its analyses. All communication to/from the `develop server` happens over a TCP socket (default: 5959). [Code](src/server/)
3. UI (red): The red boxes are the UI of the VS Code extension. The UI gets updated by the `develop server`. TODO: The VS Code extension spawns the `develop server` and tears it down. They also exchange a heart beat for failures and unclean VS Code exits. [Code](src/user_interface/)

### Publishing

#### pip package

> [!NOTE]
> Ask Ferdi if you don't have the keys to our TestPyPI and/or PyPI account.

1. ‼️ Check `pyproject.toml`: Does everything look like what you want to upload (version number, package name). The package description that will appear on PyPI is in `PKG_README.md`.
2. Install `pip install build twine` if you haven't already.
3. Run `python -m build` in root dir. This wil create a `dist/` dir.
4. Test locally: `pip install dist/agops_bird-0.0.2-py3-none-any.whl` (you need to check the name of the `.whl` file).
5. Do a test upload, it's worth it. Publish to TestPyPI first: `python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`. Then try to install from TestPyPi.
6. When installing from TestPyPI, do the following (just swap out the package name): `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ agops-bird==0.0.6`
1. Upload to PyPI: `python -m twine upload dist/*`


#### VS Code extension

1. ‼️ Look at `src/user_interface/package.json`. Make sure name, description, version are what you want.
1. Install `npm install -g @vscode/vsce` if you haven't already.
2. `cd src/user_interface`
3. Create VSIX package: `vsce package` . If you get errors like `npm error extraneous`, you need to `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
4. `vsce publish`. Ask Ferdi for personal access token if you don't have it.
