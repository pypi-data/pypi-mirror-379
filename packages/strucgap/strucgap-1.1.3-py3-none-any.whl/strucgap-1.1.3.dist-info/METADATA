# StrucGAP

**Structural and site-specific Glycoproteomics Analysis Platform**

**StrucGAP** is a modular toolkit for downstream analysis of glycoproteomics data. It includes support for preprocessing, glycan structure analysis, quantification, network visualization, functional annotation, and more.

View the [**documentation**](https://strucgap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more information.

## Installation

```bash
pip install strucgap
```

## Troubleshooting

StrucGAP works successfully on Python **3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10**,  
but for stability we recommend **Python 3.9 or 3.10**.

>  Most errors are caused by incompatible versions of **NumPy** and **pandas**.

- For **Python 3.7 and 3.8** → use **NumPy 1.18.1**  
- For **Python 3.9 and 3.10** → use **NumPy 1.26.4**  
- For all Python versions → use **pandas 1.3.5**

### Q1: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'statsmodels'`

**A1:**
```bash
pip install statsmodels
```

### Q2: `ImportError: Missing optional dependency 'openpyxl'`

**A2:**
```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

### Q3: `TypeError: loop of ufunc does not support argument 0 of type float which has no callable log2 method`

**A3:**
```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4
pip install pandas==1.3.5
```

### Q4: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'importlib.metadata'`
Cause: This package is included in the Python standard library only since version 3.8.

**A4:**
```bash
pip install importlib-metadata==6.7.0
```

### Q5: During installation, I see errors mentioning Rust or Cargo. Do StrucGAP or gseapy depend on Rust?

Cause: Neither StrucGAP nor gseapy requires Rust directly. However, in some environments pip may try to compile dependencies from source (instead of using pre-built wheels). When that happens, Rust may be required if the dependency’s source build involves it.

**A5:**
Alternatively, ensure that your environment has access to the official Python package index (PyPI) so wheels can be downloaded.  
If compilation still occurs, you may need to install Rust temporarily, but this is not normally required.
