## Overview

This is an Python package for analyzing and visualizing data from Microsoft Viva Insights.

Access to the Analyst Experience is required. With this library, you can generate visualizations and compute analyses in a way that adheres to the analysis best practices of the Viva Insights query outputs. 

For the full package documentation, please see [here](https://microsoft.github.io/vivainsights-py/). The **vivainsights** library is published on the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/vivainsights/). 

For users who prefer R to Python, we recommend the [R library counterpart](https://microsoft.github.io/vivainsights/) which mirrors the design of the Python package.
