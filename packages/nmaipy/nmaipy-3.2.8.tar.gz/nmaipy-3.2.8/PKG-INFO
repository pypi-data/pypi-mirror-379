              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

# nmaipy - Nearmap AI Python Library

Extract building footprints, vegetation, damage assessments, and other AI features from Nearmap's aerial imagery using simple Python code.

## What is nmaipy?

nmaipy (pronounced "en-my-pie") is a Python library that makes it easy for data scientists to access Nearmap's AI-powered geospatial data. Whether you're analyzing a few properties or processing millions of buildings across entire cities, nmaipy handles the complexity so you can focus on your analysis.

## Quick Start for Data Scientists

### 1. Install

#### Option A: Using pip
```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### Option B: Using conda

Minimal installation (core features only):
```bash
conda env create -f environment-minimal.yaml
conda activate nmaipy
```

Full installation (includes development and notebook tools):
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate nmaipy
```

#### Option C: Install into existing conda environment
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge geopandas pandas numpy pyarrow psutil pyproj python-dotenv requests rtree shapely stringcase tqdm
pip install -e .
```

#### Additional options

For running notebooks with pip:
```bash
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"
```

For development with pip:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 2. Set your API key

```bash
export API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run your first extraction

```python
from nmaipy.exporter import AOIExporter

# Extract building and vegetation data
exporter = AOIExporter(
    aoi_file='my_parcels.geojson',  # Your areas of interest
    output_dir='results',            # Where to save outputs
    country='au',                     # au, us, nz, or ca
    packs=['building', 'vegetation'], # What features to extract
    processes=4                       # Parallel processing
)

exporter.run()
```

That's it! Your results will be saved as CSV or Parquet files in the output directory.

## Common Use Cases

### 🏢 Urban Planning
Extract comprehensive data about buildings, vegetation coverage, and surface materials:

```python
exporter = AOIExporter(
    aoi_file='city_blocks.geojson',
    output_dir='urban_analysis',
    country='au',
    packs=['building', 'vegetation', 'surfaces', 'solar'],
    save_features=True,  # Get individual features, not just summaries
    include_parcel_geometry=True  # Keep boundaries for GIS analysis
)
```

### 🌊 Disaster Response
Assess damage after natural disasters like hurricanes or floods:

```python
exporter = AOIExporter(
    aoi_file='affected_areas.geojson',
    output_dir='damage_assessment',
    country='us',
    packs=['damage'],
    since='2024-07-08',  # Date range of the event
    until='2024-07-11',
    rapid=True,  # Use rapid post-catastrophe imagery
    save_features=True
)
```

### 🌳 Environmental Analysis
Study vegetation coverage and tree canopy:

```python
exporter = AOIExporter(
    aoi_file='study_area.geojson',
    output_dir='vegetation_study',
    country='au',
    packs=['vegetation'],
    save_features=True  # Get individual tree polygons
)
```

### 🏊 Market Research
Find properties with pools or solar panels:

```python
exporter = AOIExporter(
    aoi_file='suburbs.geojson',
    output_dir='market_analysis',
    country='au',
    packs=['pools', 'solar'],
    include_parcel_geometry=True
)
```

## Available AI Features

Some of the more common AI packs are below - there are more and growing, available via API request or on the Nearmap help.nearmap.com page.

| Pack | Description | Example Use Cases |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `building` | Building footprints and heights | Urban planning, property analysis |
| `vegetation` | Trees and vegetation coverage | Environmental studies, urban forestry |
| `surfaces` | Ground surface materials | Permeability studies, heat mapping |
| `pools` | Swimming pool detection | Compliance, market research |
| `solar` | Solar panel detection | Renewable energy assessment |
| `damage` | Post-disaster damage classification | Insurance, emergency response |
| `building_characteristics` | Detailed roof types, materials | Detailed property analysis |

## Input Data Formats

nmaipy accepts areas of interest (AOIs) in several formats:

- **GeoJSON**: Standard geospatial format with polygons
- **Parquet**: Efficient columnar format for large datasets  
- **CSV**: Simple format with lat/lon coordinates or WKT geometries

Your input file should contain polygon geometries representing the areas you want to analyze (parcels, census blocks, suburbs, etc.).

## Output Data

Results are saved as CSV or Parquet files containing:

- **Rollups**: Summary statistics per AOI (counts, areas, percentages)
- **Features**: Individual AI features with geometries (when `save_features=True`)
- **Metadata**: Survey dates, data quality metrics

## Examples

Check out `examples.py` for complete working examples of different use cases.

For a minimal example, see `run.py`.

## Working with Large Areas

nmaipy automatically handles large areas by:
- Splitting them into manageable grid cells
- Processing in parallel
- Combining results seamlessly

For areas larger than 1 sq km, the library will automatically use gridding:

```python
exporter = AOIExporter(
    aoi_file='large_region.geojson',
    output_dir='large_area_results',
    country='us',
    packs=['building'],
    aoi_grid_inexact=True,  # Allow mixing survey dates if needed
    processes=16  # Use more processes for speed
)
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Use parallel processing**: Set `processes` to the number of CPU cores
2. **Process in chunks**: Use `chunk_size` for very large datasets
3. **Cache results**: Reuse cached API responses with `cache_dir`
4. **Filter by date**: Use `since` and `until` to get specific time periods

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation and advanced options, see the [API Reference](docs/api.md).

## Getting Help

- **Examples**: See `examples.py` for common use cases
- **Notebooks**: Check the `notebooks/` directory for Jupyter notebook tutorials
- **Issues**: Report bugs or request features on [GitHub](https://github.com/nearmap/nmaipy)

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Nearmap API key (contact Nearmap for access)
- 4GB+ RAM recommended for large extractions

## Advanced: Building a Conda Package

For system administrators who want to create a local conda package:

```bash
conda build conda.recipe
conda install --use-local nmaipy
```

This will create a conda package that can be shared internally or uploaded to a conda channel.
