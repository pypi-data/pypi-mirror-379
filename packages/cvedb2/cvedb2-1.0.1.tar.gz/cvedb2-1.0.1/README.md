# CVEdb2

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cvedb2.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/cvedb2)
[![Tests](https://github.com/ahntenna/cvedb2/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ahntenna/cvedb2/actions)

## This project is forked from https://github.com/trailofbits/cvedb
# ```*** Support NVD CVE version 2.0 ***```

CVEdb is yet another Python CVE database library and utility. There are lots already available. Why create another?
Most existing libraries rely on a third party API like [cve.circl.lu](https://cve.circl.lu/), which can and do
throttle usage, require registration, and/or demand an internet connection. Some libraries are bloated, including web
interfaces for search.

CVEdb Features:
* Can be used either as a library or a command line utility
* Simple API
* Download directly from the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds)
* Automatically, incrementally update at any time

CVEdb Anti-Features:
* Does not require many dependencies
* Does not have a web server
* Does not require Internet connectivity other than to download new CVEs

## Installation

```console
$ pip3 install cvedb2
```

## Command Line Usage

```console
$ cvedb2 --help
```

## Python Examples

```python
from cvedb2.db import CVEdb

with CVEdb.open() as db:
    for cve in db.data():
        print(cve)
```

By default, the CVEs downloaded from NIST are saved to a sqlite database stored in `cvedb.db.DEFAULT_DB_PATH`, which is
set to `~/.config/cvedb/cvedb.sqlite`. This can be customized by passing the `db_path` argument to `CVEdb.open`.

The `db.data()` function returns an instance of a `cvedb.feed.Data` object, which has
[numerous methods to query CVEs](https://github.com/trailofbits/cvedb/blob/master/cvedb/feed.py).
For example:
```python
with CVEdb.open() as db:
    for cve in db.data().search("search term"):
        print(cve)
```
In addition to accepting strings, the `data().search(...)` function will accept any
[`cvedb.search.SearchQuery` object](https://github.com/trailofbits/cvedb/blob/master/cvedb/search.py).

## Known Issues

The NIST National Vulnerability Database is in the process of transitioning to a new REST API. The datasets on which
CVEdb is built are still available, but it is unclear whether they may become deprecated. Also, NIST has started rate
limiting downloads, which may affect CVEdb syncing. Therefore, CVEdb ships
[pre-seeded with a database](https://github.com/trailofbits/cvedb/tree/master/cvedb/data). Therefore, CVEdb does not
require any Internet connectivity after it is installed, other than to download new CVE definitions. Also, the behavior
of CVEdb was changed from automatically checking for updates as necessary to now requiring the user explicitly request
an update with the new `--update` argument. Support for the new REST API is being tracked in
[this GitHub issue](https://github.com/trailofbits/cvedb/issues/3).
