    This class is used to save sensor data in a netCDF format, which is commonly used for
    storing large datasets, especially in the field of oceanography and environmental science.
    The provided data is expected to be in an xarray Dataset format.

    Example usage:
        writer = NetCdfWriter(data)
        writer.write("output_file.nc")
    
    Attributes:
    ------------
    data : xr.Dataset
        The xarray Dataset containing the sensor data to be written to a netCDF file.

    Methods:
    ------------
    __init__(data: xr.Dataset):
        Initializes the NetCdfWriter with the provided xarray Dataset.
    write(file_name: str):
        Writes the xarray Dataset to a netCDF file with the specified file name.
    file_extension: str
        The default file extension for this writer, which is '.nc'.
