## Installation

To install SeaSenseLib, we strongly recommend using a scientific Python distribution. 
If you already have Python, you can install SeaSenseLib with:

```bash
pip install seasenselib
```

Now you're ready to use the library.

## How to import SeaSenseLib

Example code for using the SeaSenseLib library in your project:

```python
from seasenselib.readers import SbeCnvReader, NetCdfReader
from seasenselib.writers import NetCdfWriter
from seasenselib.plotters import TimeSeriesPlotter

# Read CTD data from CNV file
reader = SbeCnvReader("sea-practical-2023.cnv")
dataset = reader.get_data()

# Write dataset with CTD data to netCDF file
writer = NetCdfWriter(dataset)
writer.write('sea-practical-2023.nc')

# Plot CTD data
plotter = TimeSeriesPlotter(dataset)
plotter.plot(parameter_name='temperature')
```

## CLI Usage

You can use the tool for reading, converting, and plotting CTD data based on Seabird CNV files.
This chapter describes how to run the program from CLI. 

After installing as a Python package, you can run it via CLI by just using the package name: 

```bash
seasenselib
```
The various features of the tool can be executed by using different commands. To invoke a command, simply append 
it as an argument to the program call via CLI (see following example section for some examples). The 
following table gives a short overview of the available commands.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `formats` | Display all supported input file formats. |
| `convert` | Converts a file of a specific instrument format to a netCDF, CSV, or Excel file. |
| `show` | Shows the summary for a input file of a specific instrument format.  |
| `plot-ts` | Plots a T-S diagram based on data from an input file. Via argument you can plot on screen or into a file. |
| `plot-profile` | Plots a vertical profile based on data from the input file. Via argument you can plot on screen or into a file. |
| `plot-series` | Plots a time series based on a given parameter from the input file. Via argument you can plot on screen or into a file. |

Every command uses different parameters. To get more information about how to use the 
program and each command, just run it with the `--help` (or `-h`) argument:

```bash
seasenselib --help
```

To get help for a single command, add `--help` (or `-h`) argument after typing the command name:

```bash
seasenselib convert --help
```

## Example data

In the `examples` directory of the [code repository](https://github.com/ocean-uhh/seasenselib) you'll find example files from real research cruises.

- The file `sea-practical-2023.cnv` contains data from a vertical CTD profile (one downcast) with parameters `temperature`, `salinity`, `pressure`, `oxygen`, `turbidity`.
- The file `denmark-strait-ds-m1-17.cnv` contains data from an instrument moored over six days in a depth of around 650 m with parameters `temperature`, `salinity`, `pressure`.

The following examples will guide you through all available commands using the file `sea-practical-2023.cnv`. (Please note: these examples are the simplest way to work with data. The behavior of the program can be adjusted with additional arguments, as you can figure out by calling the help via CLI.)

### Converting a CNV file to netCDF

Use the following command to convert a CNV file to a netCDF file:

```bash
seasenselib convert -i examples/sea-practical-2023.cnv -o output/sea-practical-2023.nc
```

As you can see, format detection works for this command via file extension (`.nc` for netCDF or `.csv` for CSV), but you can also specify it via argument `--format` (or `-f`).

Important note: Our example files work out of the box. But in some cases your Seabird CNV files are using column names (so called "channels") for the parameter values, which
are not known of our program or the `pycnv` library which we're using. If you get an error due to missing parameters while converting or if you miss parameters during further data processing, e.g. something essential like the temperature, then a parameter mapping might be necessary. A parameter mapping is performed with the argument `--mapping` (or `-m`), which is followed by a list of mapping pairs separated with spaces. A mapping pair consists of a standard parameter name that we use within the program and the corresponding name of the column or channel from the Seabird CNV file. Example for a mapping which works for the example above:

```bash
seasenselib convert -i examples/sea-practical-2023.cnv -o output/sea-practical-2023.nc -m temperature=tv290C pressure=prdM salinity=sal00 depth=depSM
```

### Showing the summary of a netCDF

For the created netCDF file:

```bash
seasenselib show -i output/sea-practical-2023.nc
```

Again, format detection works also for this command via file extension (`.nc` for netCDF, `.csv` for CSV, `.cnv` for CNV).

### Plotting a T-S diagram, vertical profile and time series from a netCDF file

Plot a T-S diagram:

```bash
seasenselib plot-ts -i output/sea-practical-2023.nc
```

Plot a vertical CTD profile:

```bash
seasenselib plot-profile -i output/sea-practical-2023.nc
```

Plot a time series for 'temperature' parameter:

```bash
seasenselib plot-series -i output/sea-practical-2023.nc -p temperature salinity --dual-axis
```

Also for this command, format detection works via file extension (`.nc` for netCDF, `.csv` for CSV, `.cnv` for CNV).

To save the plots into a file instead showing on screen, just add the parameter `--output` (or `-o`) followed by the path of the output file. 
The file extension determines in which format the plot is saved. Use `.png` for PNG, `.pdf` for PDF, and `.svg` for SVG.

## Development

Start here to set up your local development environment: clone the repository, create and activate a Python virtual environment, install all dependencies, and run tests or build the package. These steps ensure you work in an isolated, reproducible setup so you can experiment with the code, add new features, or fix issues before submitting changes.

1. **Clone the repo**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ocean-uhh/seasenselib.git
   cd seasenselib
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   - Linux/macOS:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - Windows (CMD):

     ```
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```

   - Windows (PowerShell):

     ```
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

3. **Upgrade packaging tools and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

The environment is now ready.

Useful commands: 

- **Run tests**

  ```bash
  python -m unittest discover tests/
  ```

- **Execute the application**

  ```bash
  python -m seasenselib
  ```

- **Build distributions**

  ```bash
  python -m build
  ```

- **Deactivate/Quit the virtual environment**

  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```
