    Added API test support for keystone default roles and scoped tokens.
issues:
  - |
    Currently the API tests will not pass with the
    keystone_default_roles-policy.yaml override file. This is due to the
    tempest framework credentials do not yet support token scopes.
    This issue is tracked in https://bugs.launchpad.net/tempest/+bug/1917168
    Once that bug is fixed, octavia-tempest-plugin can be updated to use the
    required scope in the test credentials.
upgrade:
  - |
    Two new tempest.conf settings enable/disable keystone default roles and
    scoped token testing, [enforce_scope] octavia = True/False and
    [load_balancer] enforce_new_defaults = True/False.
