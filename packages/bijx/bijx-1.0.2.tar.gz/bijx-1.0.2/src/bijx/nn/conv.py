Symmetric convolutions with group invariance for lattice field theory.

This module implements convolutions that preserve spatial symmetries,
particularly useful for lattice field theory applications.
This is implemented by explicit parameter sharing forcing equivariance.
In particular, only the "trivial" representation is supported with respect to
the channel "fibers" (i.e. spatial scalar "images" to scalar "images").

Key components:
    - :class:`ConvSym`: Symmetric convolution layer with orbit-based parameter sharing
    - :func:`kernel_d4`: D4 symmetry group (rotations and reflections) for 2D lattices
    - :func:`kernel_equidist`: Distance-based parameter sharing for isotropic kernels.

Symmetric convolutions implement convolutions that commute with group actions:
$$g \cdot (W * x) = W * (g \cdot x)$$
where $g$ is a group element (rotation, reflection, etc.)
and $W$ is the convolution kernel.

This is achieved through orbit decomposition, where lattice sites are grouped
into orbits of equivalent positions under the symmetry group. Parameters are
shared within each orbit, reducing the parameter count and enforcing
the desired symmetries.

The orbit construction is implemented somewhat naively, by simply applying
the group operators to lattice indices and collecting the results.
