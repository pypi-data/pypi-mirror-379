r"""
Nonlinear feature transformations for neural network layers.

This module provides nonlinear feature mappings for the vector fields of
continuous normalizing flows.

For continuous normalizing flows, the divergence of the feature map is computed
automatically using the vector-Jacobian product:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} =
\text{tr}\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}\right)
$$

This enables efficient computation of log-density changes in normalizing flows,
as the non-linear features are applied "locally".
