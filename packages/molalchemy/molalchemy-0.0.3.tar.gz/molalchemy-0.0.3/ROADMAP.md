# molalchemy Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for molalchemy, a SQLAlchemy extension for working with chemical cartridges in PostgreSQL. The roadmap is organized by development phases and includes specific opportunities for contributors.

## üéØ Project Vision

molalchemy aims to be the **definitive Python library** for chemical database operations, providing:
- Integration between Python and chemical databases
- Support for all major chemical cartridges (Bingo, RDKit)
- Type-safe, modern SQLAlchemy 2.0+ API with full IDE support (type hints, autocompletion)
- Production-ready Docker containers for easy deployment
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## üìä Current Status

- **Bingo PostgreSQL Integration**
  - ‚úÖ Chemical indices (`BingoMolIndex`, etc.)
  - ‚ùå Most data types (`BingoMol`, `BingoBinaryMol`, `BingoReaction`, `BingoBinaryReaction`) (fingerprints planned)
  - ‚ùå Function library (`mol`, `rxn`), some conversion and export functions missing
  - ‚ùå Full documentation with examples

- **RDKit PostgreSQL Integration**
  - ‚úÖ Core data types (`RdkitMol`, fingerprint types)
  - ‚ùå Basic function library
  - ‚ùå Missing: Complete function set, tests, documentation

- **Infrastructure**
  - ‚úÖ Modern development setup (uv, ruff, pytest, pre-commit)
  - üöß Docker containers for Bingo and RDKit
  - ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline setup
  - üöß Documentation framework (MkDocs + mkdocstrings)


### üöß **In Progress**
- Documentation enhancements
- RDKit module completion
- Docker image optimization

### ‚ùå **Not Started**
- ChemAxon cartridge integration (closed source, requires license)
- NextMove Author integration (closed source, requires license)
- Multi-dialect support for Bingo (e.g MySQL, Oracle)
- SQLite RDKit support (including custom builds or custom event listeners)
- Performance benchmarking
- Advanced chemical operations

## To be discussed

### How to handle functions

Currently both Bingo and Rdkit functions under the hood just use SQLAlchemy's `func` to call the underlying SQL functions.
Wrapping them in Python functions allows for type hints and better IDE support. However, this approach is not the prefered SQLAlchemy way, it expects the functions to be registedred using `sqlalchemy.sql.functions.Function`, which allows to e.g define the expected return type and provides some internal validation(i guess?)

Also, for now, I splitted the functions module into the separte namespace modules based on the function's input type (e.g `mol`, `rxn`, `fp`), which makes it easier to find the functions, but clutters the top-level namespace. Maybe it would be better to have a flat structure with all functions in one module?

Also is it worth to create a common interface with all common functions, so the cartridges can be used interchangeably to some extent?


Also now some functions have the name straight from the SQL function (e.g `mol_from_smiles`), while others have more Pythonic names (e.g `tanimoto` instead of `tanimoto_sml`). Should we standardize on one approach?

### Multi-dialect support

Currently the library is tightly coupled to PostgreSQL, as RDkit extension is only available for PostgreSQL. But technically for Bingo and some other closed source cartridges (e.g ChemAxon) it would be possible to support other databases (e.g MySQL, Oracle).

## üê≥ Docker Container Strategy

### **Current Docker Infrastructure**

We maintain Docker containers for each supported cartridge to ensure easy deployment and consistent environments.

#### **Existing Containers**
- PostgreSQL with Bingo cartridge
- PostgreSQL with RDKit cartridge



#### **Documentation**
- Container usage guides
- Environment variable reference
- Volume mounting best practices
- Production deployment guides

## üîß Development Environment

### **For Contributors**

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/asiomchen/molalchemy.git
cd molalchemy
uv sync

# Start development database
docker-compose up bingo  # or rdkit

# Run tests
make test

# Start documentation server
uv run mkdocs serve
```

### **Development Guidelines**

#### **Code Quality**
- Type hints for all public APIs
- 100% test coverage for new features
- Documentation for all public functions
- Follow existing code patterns

#### **Testing Requirements**
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Docker-based testing for CI/CD

#### **Documentation Standards**
- NumPy-style docstrings
- Working code examples
- API reference completeness
- User guide updates
