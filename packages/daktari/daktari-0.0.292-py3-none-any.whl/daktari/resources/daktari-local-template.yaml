# Generated by daktari
# This file allows you to override daktari behaviour for your local machine.
# It should therefore not be added to source control, e.g. via .gitignore

# Use the following to suppress checks by name (printed in square brackets when daktari runs)
# Dependent checks will be ignored automatically and don't need to also be listed
ignoredChecks:
 - example.check
 - example.check.two

# Update to make daktari always run in quiet mode (equivalent to --quiet flag)
alwaysQuiet: false
