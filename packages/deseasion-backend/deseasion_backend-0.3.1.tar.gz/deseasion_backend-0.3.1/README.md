# deSEAsion

deSEAsion is a collaborative support tool for maritime decision making.

## deseasion-backend

This package contains its backend, as the namespace package `deseasion.backend`.
It can be installed simply:

```bash
pip install deseasion-backend
```

Alternatively, you can install it from its source repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/decide.imt-atlantique/deseasion.git
cd deseasion/backend
pip install .
```

It is not meant to be used outside a docker container with the whole application stack.
We are only distributing this package so the backend can be easily expanded by users with specific needs for which the generic deSEAsion backend is not enough.

However, you can test the backend easily. It needs an `instance/config.py` file in the directory in which you will run it which you can either copy from `deseasion/backend/instance-example` or generate from the `deseasion/backend` directory using the bash script `configure-backend.sh`.
In the latter case, you will need to supply at least the following environment variables:

```bash
DB_URI             # URI of the Postgresql/PostGIS database
CELERY_BROKER_URL  # URL of the Redis broker used by celery to communicate with the backend
```

Once setup, you can run the backend with:

```bash
python -m deseasion.backend.app
# or
ENV FLASK_APP=deseasion.backend.app
flask run
```

You can run a celery worker from the same directory (sharing the same `instance/config.py` file) with:

```bash
celery -A deseasion.backend.app.celery worker
```
