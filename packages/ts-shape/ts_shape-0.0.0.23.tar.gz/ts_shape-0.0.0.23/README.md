----

This repository contains the *ts-shape* python package. The abbreviation stands for

*"Time Series shaping with rule based methods"*.

ts-shape is a Python library for efficiently transforms, contextualizes and extracts events from time series data. It provides a set of tools to handle various transformations, making data preparation tasks easier and more intuitive.

Besides that multiple engineering specific methods are utilized to make it fast and easy to work with time series data.
