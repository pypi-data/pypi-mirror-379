        """
        Filters the DataFrame based on a set of user-defined conditions passed as a string.

        This method allows for flexible data filtering by evaluating a condition or multiple conditions
        specified in the 'conditions' parameter. The conditions must be provided as a string
        that can be interpreted by pandas' DataFrame.query() method.

        Args:
        - dataframe (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame to apply the filter on.
        - conditions (str): A string representing the conditions to filter the DataFrame.
                            The string should be formatted according to pandas query syntax.

        Returns:
        - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing only the rows that meet the specified conditions.

        Example:
        --------
        # Given a DataFrame 'df' containing columns 'age' and 'score':
        >>> filtered_data = CustomFilter.filter_custom_conditions(df, "age > 30 and score > 80")
        >>> print(filtered_data)

        Note:
        - Ensure that the column names and values used in conditions match those in the DataFrame.
        - Complex expressions and functions available in pandas query syntax can also be used.
        """
        return dataframe.query(conditions)
