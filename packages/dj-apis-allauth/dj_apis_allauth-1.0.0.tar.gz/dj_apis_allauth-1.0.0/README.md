## Requirements
- Django >= 4.2
- Python >= 3.12

## Quick Setup

Install package

    pip install dj-apis-allauth
    
Add `dj_api_auth` app to INSTALLED_APPS in your django settings.py:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...,
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    ...,
    'dj_apis_allauth'
)
```
    
Add URL patterns

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('dj-apis-allauth/', include('dj_apis_allauth.urls')),
]
```
    

(Optional) Use Http-Only cookies

```python
REST_AUTH = {
    'USE_JWT': True,
    'JWT_AUTH_COOKIE': 'jwt-auth',
}
```

### Testing

Install required modules with `pip install -r  dj_apis_allauth/tests/requirements.txt`

To run the tests within a virtualenv, run `python runtests.py` from the repository directory.
The easiest way to run test coverage is with [`coverage`](https://pypi.org/project/coverage/),
which runs the tests against all supported Django installs. To run the test coverage 
within a virtualenv, run `coverage run ./runtests.py` from the repository directory then run `coverage report`.

#### Tox

Testing may also be done using [`tox`](https://pypi.org/project/tox/), which
will run the tests against all supported combinations of Python and Django.

Install tox, either globally or within a virtualenv, and then simply run `tox`
from the repository directory. As there are many combinations, you may run them
in [`parallel`](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#cmdoption-tox-p)
using `tox --parallel`.

The `tox.ini` includes an environment for testing code [`coverage`](https://pypi.org/project/coverage/)
and you can run it and view this report with `tox -e coverage`.

Linting may also be performed via [`flake8`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)
by running `tox -e flake8`.
