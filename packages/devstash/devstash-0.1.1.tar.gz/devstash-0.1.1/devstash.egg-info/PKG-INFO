# devstash

**devstash** is a development-time utility for **persistent caching** of function return values across multiple program executions.  

When you’re iterating on code, you often hit the same **slow lines** (e.g. heavy computations, file parsing, data processing) or **expensive lines** (e.g. LLM requests that cost tokens/money). With devstash, you can mark those lines once and cache the results on disk — so the next run reuses the cached values instead of re-executing them.  

That means:
- 🚀 **Faster iteration** while debugging or prototyping  
- 💸 **Save money** by skipping repeated LLM/API calls  
- 🧘 **No wasted time** waiting for recomputation during development  
- 🌐 **Offline development** after the first run, since cached API/web results are replayed without needing network access  
- 🧪 **Deterministic results** for easier debugging — results are identical every run  
- 🧰 **Mock-friendly cache files** that can be reused as test data, eliminating the need to hit real APIs or recompute fixtures  
- 🔍 **Transparent storage** in a `.devstash_cache/` folder — easy to inspect, clear, or share  
- 👥 **Team-ready**: share cached results across machines to save setup time

## ⚡ Quickstart <a id="quickstart"></a>

Install and run in seconds:

```bash
pip install devstash
```

```python
import time
import devstash

devstash.activate()  # ✅ enable caching for this run

def slow_function(x):
    print("Running slow_function...")
    time.sleep(10)
    return x * 2

val = slow_function(10)  # @devstash
print(val)
```

💡 First run: prints *“Running slow_function…”* and caches the result.  
💡 Subsequent runs: instantly reuses the cached value without executing the function.  

---

## ✨ Features <a id="features"></a>

- **Cache function return values** with a simple inline marker (`# @devstash`)  
- **Argument-sensitive caching**: separate cache entries are created for different function arguments and keyword arguments.  
- **Safe file handling**: cache filenames are sanitized to avoid injection or invalid filename issues, and truncated to avoid OS filename length limits.  
- **Transparent disk storage** in a `./.devstash_cache/` folder  
- **Automatic restore**: cached values are re-injected into your program on the next run  
- **Logging integration**: view caching activity with Python’s logging system  
- **Zero dependencies** (just Python stdlib)  
- **Optional TTL (time-to-live)** to expire cache after a given time (e.g. `30m`, `2h`, `1d`, `1w`)  
- **Command-line tools**: manage cache files with ease (list, clear, inspect).

## 🔥 Use Cases <a id="use-cases"></a>

### 🧑‍🔬 Expensive LLM calls <a id="expensive-llm-calls"></a>
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import devstash

devstash.activate()

client = OpenAI()
prompt = "Summarize War and Peace in 3 sentences."

summary = client.chat.completions.create(  # @devstash
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)
print(summary.choices[0].message["content"])
```

### 📊 Large file parsing <a id="large-file-parsing"></a>
```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
import devstash

devstash.activate()

loader = PyPDFLoader("A_LARGE_PDF_DOCUMENT.pdf")
docs = loader.load()  # @devstash

print(f"Number of docs: {len(docs)}")
```

### 🧮 Machine learning <a id="machine-learning"></a>
```python
import logging, time
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import devstash

devstash.activate()

start = time.time()

X, y = fetch_openml("mnist_784", version=1, return_X_y=True, as_frame=False, parser="liac-arff") # @devstash
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # @devstash
pipe = make_pipeline(PCA(n_components=50), LogisticRegression(max_iter=2000))
pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)  # @devstash
acc = pipe.score(X_test, y_test) # @devstash

print(f"Accuracy: {acc:.3f}")
print("Program execution time: %.2f s" % (time.time() - start))

# Output from the first run when the cache is cold:
# Accuracy: 0.908
# Program execution time: 29.67 s

# Output from the second run when the cache is warm:
# Accuracy: 0.908
# Program execution time: 0.68 s
```

### 💾 API responses <a id="api-responses"></a>
```python
import requests
import devstash

devstash.activate()

url = "https://api.github.com/repos/langchain-ai/langchain"
resp = requests.get(url)  # @devstash ttl=24h
repo_info = resp.json()

print(repo_info["stargazers_count"])
```

### ⏳ Cache with Time-To-Live (TTL) <a id="cache-with-time-to-live-ttl"></a>
You can add an optional `ttl` parameter to your `# @devstash` marker.  
TTL values can be expressed in **seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h), days (d), or weeks (w)**.  
Examples: `30m`, `2h`, `1d`, `1w`.

```python
import devstash, requests

devstash.activate()

url = "https://api.github.com/repos/langchain-ai/langchain"

# Cache result for 1 day, then refresh
resp = requests.get(url)  # @devstash ttl=1d
print(resp.json()["stargazers_count"])
```

- First run: makes the API call and caches the result.  
- Subsequent runs within 1 day: loads directly from cache.  
- After 1 day: re-fetches and updates the cache automatically.

## 🛠️ How It Works <a id="how-it-works"></a>

devstash works by transforming your program at runtime:

1. **Explicit activation**: When you call `devstash.activate()`, it reads your main script (the entrypoint in `sys.argv[0]`).  
2. **Build an AST**: The code is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), a structured representation of your Python source.  
3. **Rewrite annotated lines**: Function calls marked with `# @devstash` are rewritten to wrap them with the persistent cache helper.  
4. **Compile and exec**: The rewritten AST is compiled back into Python bytecode and executed in a fresh `__main__` namespace.  
5. **Persistent storage**: Values are stored on disk using pickle, and automatically restored on subsequent runs.  
6. **TTL support**: Before reading a cache file, devstash checks its last-modified time. If the file is older than the specified TTL, the cache is refreshed.  
7. **Safe filenames**: All cache filenames are sanitized to prevent injection and truncated to fit within common OS filename length limits.

👉 If you don’t want rewriting in a certain environment, set:  
```bash
export DEVSTASH_SKIP_REWRITE=1
```

## 🖥️ CLI Tools  <a id="cli-tools"></a>

devstash includes a simple CLI for managing your cache:

```bash
$ devstash list --ttl 1m                                                                                                                          [19:49:21]
Cache File                                                                                Age           TTL Status
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
openai.resources.embeddings__Embeddings.create__1e53b9c3f5768615.pkl                    5m 8s        expired (>1m)
langchain_core.document_loaders.base__BaseLoader.load__d019ca77b2cac706.pkl                5s         valid (<=1m)
sklearn.model_selection._split__train_test_split__17b58b2de4f4cff9.pkl                    13s         valid (<=1m)
requests.api__get__0c4579007009458c.pkl                                                5m 13s        expired (>1m)                                             4m 48s                valid
```
Lists all cached files, including their size, age, and TTL if applicable.

```bash
$ devstash clear clear --pattern openai.resources.embeddings__Embeddings.create__1e53b9c3f5768615.pkl
Removed 1 cache file(s).
$ devstash clear --all                                                                                                                            [19:43:00]
Cleared all cached entries.
```
Clears out files from the `./.devstash_cache/` directory.

These commands help inspect or reset caches without manually navigating files.

## 📚 Related Work <a id="related-work"></a>

There are several existing Python libraries that provide caching or mocking functionality, but **devstash** takes a different approach designed for day-to-day development convenience.

| Tool            | Approach        | Pros                                                                    | Cons |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| [persist-cache](http://pypi.org/project/persist-cache/) | Decorator-based persistent cache | ✅ Easy to apply with decorators                                         | ❌ Requires decorating functions, not inline caching. Cannot decorate external library functions |
| [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/) | `Memory.cache()` decorator | ✅ Great for machine learning pipelines                                  | ❌ Requires explicit wrapping/decorating |
| [diskcache](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache/) | Disk-backed dictionary/decorators | ✅ Powerful and flexible                                                 | ❌ More boilerplate, extra setup |
| [vcrpy](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy) | Records/replays HTTP requests | ✅ Excellent for offline API testing                                     | ❌ Only works for HTTP calls |
| [pytest-cache](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/cache.html) | pytest-specific cache | ✅ Useful in test environments                                           | ❌ Limited to pytest, not general dev |
| **devstash** | Inline `# @devstash` marker | ✅ Zero-boilerplate, works (almost) anywhere, argument-sensitive caching | ❌ Development-only, not for production |


### 🔑 How devstash is different
Unlike the above, **devstash** focuses on *zero-boilerplate caching during development*.  
- Just add `# @devstash` to a line of code.  
- No decorators, wrappers, or test frameworks required.  
- Works with any function return value that is pickle-serializable.  
- Optimized for saving time and cost during *iterative coding*, not for production.

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations <a id="notes--limitations"></a>

- devstash is designed for **development/debugging only**, not for production caching.  
- Cached objects must be **pickle-serializable**.  
- Cache invalidation: delete `./.devstash_cache/` if values become stale.  
- Function chaining is **not supported**.  
  E.g. to avoid an API call in `requests.get(url).json()` you must split the `.json()` onto a separate line and apply the marker to the `.get()` call.  
- **TTL support**: you can specify cache expiry with `ttl=...` in the marker (`# @devstash ttl=30m`). Invalid TTL formats will raise an error. Cache freshness is determined using the **file’s last modified time**.  
- **Execution context support**: devstash currently only supports being run with the **main Python executable** (e.g. `python script.py`) or through package manager wrappers like **uv** (`uv run script.py`) or **poetry** (`poetry run python script.py`).  
  Other **runner-style tools** such as `flask run`, `uvicorn`, or `gunicorn` are **not yet supported** because they import your application as a module instead of executing it as the entrypoint.  
  Support for these wrappers is planned for the future. For now, always run your scripts directly with `python` (or `uv run` / `poetry run`).
