Welcome to PyWisp's documentation!
==================================

PyWisp stands for *Python based Weird visualisation for test bench prototypes*.

PyWisp is targeted at students and researchers working in control engineering. It helps
to implement and run a communication and visualization for a test bench. Based on the GUI
concept of `PyMoskito <https://github.com/cklb/pymoskito>`_ it is easy to use, if you have
experience with that kind of tools. It uses a similar modular structure to design a control
flow for the test bench or rig.
