# ðŸŒŸ ModXPy â€” The Python Module Universe at Your Fingertips ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to **ModXPy**, the ultimate playground for Pythonâ€™s modules.  
With ModXPy you can instantly import, explore, and experiment with the entire Python standard library â€” plus any installed third-party modules â€” all from one simple interface.

UPDATE 1.1.0
import_all() now imports sys as one of the modules, as sys is one of the "popular" 
modules in python.

---

## ðŸš€ Installation

Install directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install modxpy

In Python, import as import modx (not modxpy)


Functions: 


import_all()

Imports about every standard library module at once.

ðŸ”¹ import_random(n)

Imports n random modules from the standard library.

ðŸ”¹ import_letter(letter)

Imports all standard library modules whose names start with the given letter.

ðŸ”¹ import_external()

Attempts to import every third-party module you currently have installed.

ðŸ”¹ import_screen()

Imports every module that uses a screen/GUI (like pygame or turtle).

ðŸ”¹ list_importall()

Returns a list of modules that would be imported by import_all().

ðŸ”¹ modules_loaded()

Shows how many modules you currently have downloaded on your device.

ðŸ”¹ imported()

Lists the modules imported since ModX loaded (user + ModX), including dependencies.

ðŸ”¹ modximported()

Lists the modules that were ONLY imported by ModX, NOT including user imports
and dependencies.


Example Code:


>>> import modx
>>> modx.imported()
Modules imported after ModX load (user + ModX):
Total modules imported after ModX load: 0

>>> modx.import_random(5)
['csv', 'wave', 'tarfile', 'turtle', 'contextlib']

>>> modx.imported()
Modules imported after ModX load (user + ModX):
- csv
- wave
- tarfile
- turtle
- contextlib

Total modules imported after ModX load: 5
