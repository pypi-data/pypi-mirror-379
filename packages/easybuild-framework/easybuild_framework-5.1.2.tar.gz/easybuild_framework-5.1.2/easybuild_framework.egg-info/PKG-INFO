`EasyBuild <https://easybuild.io>`_ is a software build
and installation framework that allows you to manage (scientific) software
on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient way.

The **easybuild-framework** package is the core of EasyBuild. It
supports the implementation and use of so-called easyblocks which
implement the software install procedure for a particular (group of) software
package(s).

The EasyBuild documentation is available at http://docs.easybuild.io/.

The EasyBuild framework source code is hosted on GitHub, along
with an issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests, see
https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework.
