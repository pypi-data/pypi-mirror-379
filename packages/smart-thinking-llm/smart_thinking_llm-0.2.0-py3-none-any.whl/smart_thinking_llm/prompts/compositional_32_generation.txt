Your task is to transform a simple question into a complex one by using information from 5 provided question-answer pairs. The goal is to replace a key entity in the main question with a complex, indirect description derived from the other questions.

You are provided with 5 short-answer questions:
1. `%(question_1)s` `%(answer_1)s`
2. `%(question_2)s` `%(answer_2)s`
3. `%(question_3)s` `%(answer_3)s`
4. `%(question_4)s` `%(answer_4)s`
5. `%(question_5)s` `%(answer_5)s`

**Key data structure logic:**
- The answer to question 1 matches the answer to question 3 (A1 = A3).
- The answer to question 2 matches the answer to question 4 (A2 = A4).
- Questions 3, 4, and 5 often revolve around the same central entity.

**Follow this step-by-step algorithm precisely:**

**Step 1: Identify Components**
- **Base Question**: This is Question 5 (`%(question_5)s`).
- **Core Entity**: Find the primary subject/entity in the Base Question. This same entity is also the subject of Questions 3 and 4.
- **Property 1**: This is the fact about the Core Entity from Question 3. It links the Core Entity to Answer 3 (`%(answer_3)s`).
- **Property 2**: This is the fact about the Core Entity from Question 4. It links the Core Entity to Answer 4 (`%(answer_4)s`).

**Step 2: Create a Description of the Core Entity**
- Using Property 1 and Property 2, formulate a phrase that describes the Core Entity.
- *Example: "the place that is located in `%(answer_4)s` and is in the state of `%(answer_3)s`".*

**Step 3: Cloak the Properties in the Description**
- Now, you must replace the direct answers (`%(answer_3)s` and `%(answer_4)s`) in your description using the information from Questions 1 and 2. This is the most critical step.
- **Cloaking Property 1**: Look at Question 1. Instead of naming `%(answer_3)s` directly, describe it using the context from Question 1. For example, instead of "Arkansas", use "the same state as KAGH-FM".
- **Cloaking Property 2**: Do the same for `%(answer_4)s` using the context from Question 2. For example, instead of "White County", use "the same county as McRae".

**Step 4: Assemble the Final Complex Question**
- Take the Base Question (Question 5).
- Find the Core Entity within it.
- Replace the Core Entity with the fully cloaked description you created in Step 3.
- Ensure the final question is grammatically correct and makes logical sense.

**Example 1: Geographical**

**Input Data:**
1. What state is KAGH-FM located in? Arkansas
2. In which administrative territorial entity is McRae located? White County
3. In which state is Midway located? Arkansas
4. In which county is Midway located? White County
5. Which country is Midway located in? U.S.

**Thought Process:**
1.  **Components**: Core Entity is `Midway`. Property 1 is "located in `Arkansas`". Property 2 is "located in `White County`".
2.  **Description**: "Midway, which is located in White County, Arkansas".
3.  **Cloaking**: `Arkansas` becomes "in the same state as KAGH-FM". `White County` becomes "in the same county as McRae". The cloaked description is "the place located in the same county as McRae and in the same state as KAGH-FM".
4.  **Assembly**: Replace `Midway` in "Which country is Midway located in?" with the cloaked description.
    *   **Result**: "In which country is the place located that is in the same county as McRae and in the same state as KAGH-FM?"

**Example 2: Abstract/Non-Geographical**

**Input Data:**
1. Which award did Tony Bill win? Academy Award for Best Picture
2. Who was born in Southsea? Kathleen Lockhart
3. Which award did Gentleman's Agreement receive? Academy Award for Best Picture
4. Who is a cast member of Gentleman's Agreement? Kathleen Lockhart
5. Who is a cast member of Gentleman's Agreement? Victor Arthur Kilian

**Thought Process:**
1.  **Components**: Core Entity is `Gentleman's Agreement`. Property 1 is "received `Academy Award for Best Picture`". Property 2 is "has `Kathleen Lockhart` as a cast member".
2.  **Description**: "the film Gentleman's Agreement, which received the Academy Award for Best Picture and stars Kathleen Lockhart".
3.  **Cloaking**: `Academy Award for Best Picture` becomes "the same award that Tony Bill won". `Kathleen Lockhart` becomes "the person who was born in Southsea". The cloaked description is "the film that won the same award as Tony Bill and which features a cast member who was born in Southsea".
4.  **Assembly**: Replace `Gentleman's Agreement` in "Who is a cast member of Gentleman's Agreement?" with the cloaked description.
    *   **Result**: "Who is a cast member of the film that won the same award as Tony Bill and which features a cast member who was born in Southsea?"

As a result, you should return **only the final, complex question** generated after all transformations.
