Have you been given three questions with answers in the format `question_text ? answer`. These are the very questions:
1. %(question_1)s %(answer_1)s
2. %(question_2)s %(answer_2)s
3. %(question_3)s %(answer_3)s
The answer to the first question is part of the second question. The answer to the second question is part of the third question.
Generate a single, comprehensive question that hierarchically combines the following sequential Q&A pairs into one query, ensuring all entities are logically nested. 
The final question must directly reference the original subject and end with the ultimate answer.

2. In which administrative territorial entity is Hackney located? Middlesex
3. Which country is Middlesex located in? United Kingdom
