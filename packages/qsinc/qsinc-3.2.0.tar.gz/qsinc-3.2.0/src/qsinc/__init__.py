Qsinc - Revolutionary Quaternary Compression with Built-in Security
==================================================================

The world's first practical quaternary compression system featuring:
- Built-in temporal encryption
- Infinity timestamps (permanent encryption)  
- Burn-after-time functionality
- Patent-protected quaternary encoding
- Competitive performance with leading algorithms

Quick Start:
-----------
>>> import qsinc
>>> data = b"Hello, World!" * 1000
>>> compressor = qsinc.Qsinc(level=5)
>>> result = compressor.compress(data)
>>> print(f"Compressed {result['ratio']:.2f}:1")
>>> original = compressor.decompress(result)
>>> assert original == data  # âœ… Perfect integrity

Advanced Features:
-----------------
>>> # Permanent encryption (never expires)
>>> result = qsinc.compress_infinity(data, level=7)

>>> # Self-destructing data (burns after time)  
>>> result = qsinc.compress_and_burn(data, expire_minutes=30)
