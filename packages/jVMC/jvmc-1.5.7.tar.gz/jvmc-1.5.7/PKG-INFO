# jVMC
This is an impementation of Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) for quantum many-body dynamics using the [JAX library](https://jax.readthedocs.io "JAX library") (and [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io "FLAX library") on top) to exploit the blessings of automatic differentiation for easy model composition and just-in-time compilation for execution on accelerators.

## Documentation

Documentation is available [here](https://jvmc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "Documentation").

## Installation

### Option 1: ``pip``-install

        pip install jVMC

To install jVMC with GPU support, use

        pip install jVMC[gpu]

This is assuming, that `jax[cuda12]` will work for you (see the [JAX documentation](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#pip-installation-nvidia-gpu-cuda-installed-via-pip-easier)).

### Option 2: Clone and ``pip``-install for development

1. Clone the jVMC repository and check out the development branch:

        git clone https://github.com/markusschmitt/vmc_jax.git
        cd vmc_jax

2. ``pip``-install the package  

        pip install -e ".[dev]"

Test that everything worked, e.g. run 'python -c "import jVMC"' from a place different than ``vmc_jax``.

## Important gotchas
### Out-of-memory issues and batching
Memory requirements grow with increasing network sizes. To avoid out-of-memory issues, the ``batchSize`` parameter of the ``NQS`` class has to be adjusted. The ``batchSize`` indicates on how many input configurations the network is evaluated concurrently. Out-of-memory issues are usually resolved by reducing this number. The ``numChains`` parameter of the ``Sampler`` class for Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling plays a similar role, but its optimal values in terms of computational speed are typically not memory critical.
