# pytest-gitscope

**Smart test filtering based on Git revisions**

pytest-gitscope is a pragmatic pytest plugin that runs only the tests that matter. By analyzing your Git history, it intelligently determines which tests are affected by your changes, helping you ship faster.

## Features

Testing everything on every change is thorough but impractical. pytest-gitscope follows the principle of "test what changed" – giving you confidence in your modifications while respecting your time.

- 🎯 **Targeted Testing** - Run only tests related to modified files
- ⚡ **Fast Execution** - Dramatically reduce test execution time
- 🔍 **Git Integration** - Seamlessly works with your Git workflow
- 📊 **Smart Detection** - Automatically detects affected test files and dependencies
- 🛠️ **Flexible Filtering** - Support for commit ranges, branches, and specific revisions

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install pytest-gitscope

# Run tests affected by changes in the last commit
pytest --gitscope HEAD~1

# Run tests affected by changes between two commits
pytest --gitscope main..feature-branch
```

Perfect for CI/CD pipelines and local development to focus on what matters most.

## Understanding pytest-gitscope with a complete example

Let's walk through a real-world example to see exactly how `pytest-gitscope` works.

### Initial Project Structure

```
myproject/
├── src/
│   ├── calculator.py
│   ├── user_manager.py
│   └── utils.py
├── tests/
│   ├── test_calculator.py
│   ├── test_user_manager.py
│   ├── test_utils.py
│   └── test_integration.py
└── docs/
    └── README.md
```

### Step 1: Initial State

Your project has 15 tests total:

```bash
$ pytest --collect-only -q
15 tests collected
```

Running all tests takes 45 seconds:

```bash
$ pytest
================ 15 passed in 45.23s ================
```

### Step 2: Making Changes

You're working on a new feature and modify two files:

**Changes to `src/calculator.py`:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):  # ← NEW FUNCTION
    return a * b
```

**Changes to `docs/README.md`:**

```markdown
# MyProject

Updated documentation with new examples...
```

### Step 3: See What Git Detects

```bash
$ git diff --name-only HEAD~1
src/calculator.py
docs/README.md
```

### Step 4: Run pytest-gitscope

Instead of running all 15 tests, use pytest-gitscope:

```bash
$ pytest --gitscope HEAD~1
```

**What happens internally:**

1. **File Analysis**: pytest-gitscope runs `git diff --name-only HEAD~1`

   ```
   Changed files: ['src/calculator.py', 'docs/README.md']
   ```

2. **Test Mapping**: It identifies which tests are affected:

   ```
   src/calculator.py → tests/test_calculator.py
   docs/README.md → (no tests affected)
   ```

3. **Dependency Detection**: It scans for imports and finds:

   ```
   tests/test_integration.py imports calculator.py
   ```

4. **Final Test Selection**:
   ```
   Selected tests:
   ✓ tests/test_calculator.py (directly affected)
   ✓ tests/test_integration.py (imports calculator.py)
   ✗ tests/test_user_manager.py (not affected)
   ✗ tests/test_utils.py (not affected)
   ```

**Output:**

```bash
$ pytest --gitscope HEAD~1
========================== test session starts ==========================
gitscope: Analyzing changes from HEAD~1
collected 15 items / 7 deselected / 8 selected
Some tests have been deselected by pytest-gitscope plugin, because they have not been affected by the changes from HEAD~1

tests/test_calculator.py ✓✓✓✓✓
tests/test_integration.py ✓✓✓

=================== 8 passed, 7 deselected in 12.34s ====================
```

### Step 5: Compare the Results

| Method            | Tests Run           | Time           |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Regular pytest    | 15 tests            | 45.23s         |
| pytest --gitscope | 8 tests             | 12.34s         |
| **Savings**       | **7 tests skipped** | **73% faster** |

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Feature Branch

```bash
# Test only changes in your feature branch
$ pytest --gitscope main..feature/new-auth
gitscope: Selected 12 tests from 4 test files (28 tests skipped)
```

### Scenario 2: Last 3 Commits

```bash
# Test changes from last 3 commits
$ pytest --gitscope HEAD~3
gitscope: Selected 6 tests from 2 test files (34 tests skipped)
```

### Scenario 3: Specific Files Only

```bash
# Test only your calculator changes
$ pytest --gitscope HEAD~1 tests/test_calculator.py
gitscope: Selected 5 tests from 1 test file (35 tests skipped)
```

## What Gets Detected

✅ **Direct matches**: `src/calculator.py` → `tests/test_calculator.py`\
✅ **Import dependencies**: Files that import changed modules\
✅ **Test utilities**: Shared test fixtures and utilities\
✅ **Configuration changes**: `pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`

❌ **Documentation only**: `README.md`, `*.md` files (configurable)\
❌ **Unrelated modules**: Files with no test connections

## Important Note: Dependency Management

⚠️ **pytest-gitscope works best with projects using package managers like Poetry or uv.**

Without a proper dependency manager, pytest-gitscope might miss some test dependencies. Here's why:

**With Poetry/uv (Recommended):**

```python
# pytest-gitscope can analyze pyproject.toml and lock files
# to understand the full dependency graph
src/calculator.py → tests/test_calculator.py ✓
src/calculator.py → tests/test_math_integration.py ✓ (detected via deps)
```

**Without package manager:**

```python
# pytest-gitscope relies only on direct imports scanning
src/calculator.py → tests/test_calculator.py ✓
src/calculator.py → tests/test_math_integration.py ? (might be missed)
```

**Recommendation**: For best results, use pytest-gitscope in projects with:

- `pyproject.toml` (Poetry, uv, setuptools)
- `requirements.txt` with proper dependency tracking
- Clear import patterns

## Integration with CI/CD

Perfect for speeding up your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Run targeted tests
  run: pytest --gitscope origin/main..HEAD
```

This way, pull requests only run tests affected by the changes, dramatically reducing build times while maintaining confidence in your code quality.

## Cookbook

**Use gitscope on gitlab-ci**

Because gitlab-ci fetch the latest commit on detached mode,
you will need to fetch the target branch as a prerequisite.

```yml
Job:
  before_script:
    - git fetch --depth=1 origin ${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}
  script:
    - pytest --gitscope origin/${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}
```

**Disable short-circuiting on git push with gitlab-ci**

Sometimes you want to disable short-circuiting because updating your pyproject.toml file does not change dependencies.

Gitlab allows to provide CI/CD variables to the CI/CD pipeline, if one is created due to the push. Passes variables only to branch pipelines and not merge request pipelines.

```bash
git push -o ci.variable="PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--gitscope-no-short-circuits"
```

**Always include tests that depends on a module**

The option `--gitscope-include-module` let you include tests that depends on this module — and its submodules too, due to the way modules are imported in python.

```bash
pytest --gitscope-include-module x.y.z tests/
```
