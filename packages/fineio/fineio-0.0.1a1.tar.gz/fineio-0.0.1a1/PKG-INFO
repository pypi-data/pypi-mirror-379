# FineIO

**FineIO** â€” async foundation library for [finesql](https://pypi.org/project/finesql) and [fynor](https://pypi.org/project/fynor).  
It provides helpers that work in both **sync** and **async** code, making it easy to adopt async gradually.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fineio
```

## Quick Start

### Hello Example

```python
from fineio import hello

# âœ… Sync usage
print(hello())  # -> "fineio is alive!"

# âœ… Async usage
import asyncio

async def main():
    print(await hello())  # -> "fineio is alive!"

asyncio.run(main())
```

## How It Works

The same function **`hello()`** works in both contexts:

- If called **outside** an event loop â†’ it runs async code with `asyncio.run()` and returns the result directly.  
- If called **inside** an event loop â†’ it returns a coroutine, so you can `await` it.  

This dual-mode design makes it possible to:
- Start with **synchronous code**.  
- Move to **async gradually** without changing APIs.  

## Roadmap

- âœ… `hello()` demo function with dual sync/async support.  
- ðŸš§ Core utilities for running coroutines from sync code.  
- ðŸš§ Async helpers for finesql (database operations).  
- ðŸš§ Integration with fynor (web framework).
