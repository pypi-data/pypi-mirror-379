               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Computing instance-wise segmentation quality metrics for 2D and 3D semantic- and instance segmentation maps.

 
[Use Cases & Tutorials](#use-cases--tutorials) | [Documentation](#documentation)

## Features

The package provides three core modules:

1. Instance Approximator: instance approximation algorithms to extract instances from semantic segmentation maps/model outputs.
2. Instance Matcher: matches predicted instances with reference instances.
3. Instance Evaluator: computes segmentation and detection quality metrics for pairs of predicted - and reference segmentation maps.

![workflow_figure](https://github.com/BrainLesion/panoptica/blob/main/examples/figures/workflow.png?raw=true)

## Installation

With a Python 3.10+ environment, you can install panoptica from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/panoptica/)

```sh
pip install panoptica

# or with optional GPU capabilities 
pip install panoptica[gpu]
```


Or, alternatively, from [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/panoptica):

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge panoptica
```

## Available Metrics

> [!NOTE]
> Panoptica supports a large range of metrics. <br>
> An overview of the supported metrics and their formulas can be found here: [panoptica/metrics.md](https://github.com/BrainLesion/panoptica/tree/main/metrics.md)

## Use Cases & Tutorials


### Minimal example

A minimal example of using panoptica could look e.g. like this (here with Matched Instances as Input):
```python
from panoptica import InputType, Panoptica_Evaluator
from panoptica.metrics import Metric

ref_masks = "<path-to-your>/reference.nii.gz"
pred_masks = "<path-to-your>/prediction.nii.gz"

evaluator = Panoptica_Evaluator(
    expected_input=InputType.MATCHED_INSTANCE,
    decision_metric=Metric.IOU,
    decision_threshold=0.5,
)

result = evaluator.evaluate(pred_masks, ref_masks)["ungrouped"]
```


> [!TIP]
> We provide Jupyter Notebook tutorials showcasing various use cases. <br>
> You can explore them here: [BrainLesion/tutorials/panoptica](https://github.com/BrainLesion/tutorials/tree/main/panoptica) <br>

### Semantic Segmentation Input

<img src="https://github.com/BrainLesion/panoptica/blob/main/examples/figures/semantic.png?raw=true" alt="semantic_figure" height="300"/>

Although an instance-wise evaluation is highly relevant and desirable for many biomedical segmentation problems, they are still addressed as semantic segmentation problems due to the lack of appropriate instance labels.

This tutorial leverages all three modules of panoptica: instance approximation, -matching and -evaluation.

### Unmatched Instances Input

<img src="https://github.com/BrainLesion/panoptica/blob/main/examples/figures/unmatched_instance.png?raw=true" alt="unmatched_instance_figure" height="300"/>

It is a common issue that instance segmentation outputs feature good outlines but mismatched instance labels.
For this case, the matcher module can be utilized to match instances and the evaluator to report metrics.

### Matched Instances Input

<img src="https://github.com/BrainLesion/panoptica/blob/main/examples/figures/matched_instance.png?raw=true" alt="matched_instance_figure" height="300"/>

  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

If your predicted instances already match the reference instances, you can directly compute metrics using the evaluator module.

### Using Configs (saving and loading)

You can construct Panoptica_Evaluator (among many others) objects and save their arguments, so you can save project-specific configurations and use them later.
It uses ruamel.yaml in a readable way.

</a>


### Using Panoptica Aggregator

Using our Panoptica Aggregator, you can evaluate your data while the Aggregator takes care of writing the results into a .tsv file (threading-safe). This allows you to focus only on the important part, that is loading and iterating over your data.
From the aggregator, you can immediately get a Panoptica Statistics object that yield you the statistics over your metrics as well as create nice figures for you.

Tutorial: TBD
