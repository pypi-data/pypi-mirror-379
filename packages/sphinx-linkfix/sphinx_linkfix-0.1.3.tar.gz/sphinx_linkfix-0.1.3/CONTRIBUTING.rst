.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout dev
    git pull

2. Create a new feature branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

Making Changes
--------------

1. Make your changes in the appropriate files
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Run the test suite to ensure everything works

Running During Development
--------------------------

When running code during development, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    PYTHONPATH='/path/to/sphinx-linkfix/src' python your_script.py

Branching Model and Workflow
============================

This project follows a structured Gitflow branching model to maintain code quality and enable collaborative development.

Branch Types
------------

**main**
~~~~~~~~
- The production-ready branch
- Contains stable, tested code
- Protected branch requiring pull request reviews
- Only accepts merges from ``dev`` or ``hotfix`` branches

**dev**
~~~~~~~
- The integration branch for ongoing development
- Contains the latest development features
- All feature and bugfix branches merge here first
- Regularly merged into ``main`` when stable

**feature/***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Created for new features or enhancements
- Branched from ``dev``
- Naming convention: ``feature/feature-name`` or ``feature/issue-number-description``
- Merged back into ``dev`` via pull request

**release/***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Created for preparing a new production release
- Branched from ``dev``
- Naming convention: ``release/version-number``
- Used for final testing and bug fixes before merging into ``main``

**bugfix/***
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Created for non-urgent bug fixes
- Branched from ``dev``
- Naming convention: ``bugfix/bug-description`` or ``bugfix/issue-number-description``
- Merged back into ``dev`` via pull request

**hotfix/***
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Created for urgent production fixes
- Branched from ``main``
- Naming convention: ``hotfix/critical-issue-description``
- Merged directly into ``main`` and then back-merged into ``dev``

**meta/***
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Created for non-code changes (documentation, CI/CD, etc.)
- Branched from ``main``
- Naming convention: ``meta/change-description``
- Merged back into ``main`` via pull request

Merge Workflows
---------------

**Feature/Bugfix â†’ Dev**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Rebase ``dev`` into your feature/bugfix branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout feature/your-feature
    git fetch origin
    git rebase origin/dev

2. Create a pull request from ``feature/your-feature`` to ``dev``
3. Use **squash commit** or **squash and merge** to maintain clean commit history
4. Delete the feature branch after successful merge

**Dev â†’ Release â†’ Main**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. When ready for a release, create a release branch from ``dev``:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout dev
    git pull origin dev
    git checkout -b release/x.y.z
    git push origin release/x.y.z

2. Perform final testing and bug fixes on the release branch
3. Create a pull request from ``release/x.y.z`` to ``main``
4. Use **squash commit** for a clean release commit
5. After merge, CI pipeline will tag the release, publish packages, deploy documentation and merge ``main`` back into ``dev`` to keep branches synchronized

**Hotfix â†’ Main**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Rebase ``main`` into your hotfix branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout hotfix/critical-fix
    git fetch origin
    git rebase origin/main

2. Create a pull request from ``hotfix/critical-fix`` to ``main``
3. Use **squash and merge** for clean hotfix commits
4. After merge, CI pipeline will tag the hotfix release, publish packages, deploy documentation and merge ``main`` back into ``dev`` to keep branches synchronized

**Meta â†’ Main**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Rebase ``main`` into your meta branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout meta/your-meta-change
    git fetch origin
    git rebase origin/main

2. Create a pull request from ``meta/your-meta-change`` to ``main``
3. Use **squash and merge** for clean meta commits
4. After merge, CI pipeline will deploy documentation and merge ``main`` back into ``dev`` to keep branches synchronized

Branch Protection Rules
-----------------------

- **main**: Requires pull request reviews, status checks must pass
- **dev**: Requires pull request reviews, status checks must pass
- Direct pushes to ``main`` and ``dev`` are prohibited
- All branches must be up-to-date before merging

Workflow Examples
-----------------

**Creating a Feature**

.. code-block:: bash

    # Start from dev
    git checkout dev
    git pull origin dev

    # Create feature branch
    git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

    # Make changes and commit
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication system"

    # Push and create PR
    git push origin feature/user-authentication

**Preparing for Merge**

.. code-block:: bash

    # Before creating PR, rebase on latest dev
    git fetch origin
    git rebase origin/dev

    # Resolve conflicts if any, then force push
    git push --force-with-lease origin feature/user-authentication

Code Standards
==============

This project follows modern Python development practices:

Code Modernization with Pyupgrade
----------------------------------

We use **pyupgrade** to automatically upgrade Python syntax to use modern features:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Upgrade Python syntax for Python 3.12+
    pyupgrade --py312-plus src/**/*.py

    # Upgrade specific files
    pyupgrade --py312-plus src/sphinx_linkfix/specific_module.py

    # Upgrade all Python files recursively
    find src -name "*.py" -exec pyupgrade --py312-plus {} +

Pyupgrade automatically modernizes code by:

- Converting old string formatting to f-strings
- Updating type annotations to use modern syntax
- Replacing outdated syntax with newer equivalents
- Removing unnecessary imports and comprehensions

Docstring Formatting
---------------------

We use **docformatter** to automatically format docstrings:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Format docstrings in place
    docformatter --in-place src/**/*.py

    # Check docstring formatting without making changes
    docformatter --check src/**/*.py

    # Format specific files
    docformatter --in-place src/sphinx_linkfix/specific_module.py

Docformatter ensures:

- Consistent docstring formatting
- Proper line wrapping at the configured length
- Standardized spacing and structure
- Removal of unnecessary blank lines in docstrings

Code Formatting and Linting
----------------------------

We use **Ruff** for both linting and formatting:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Format code
    ruff format .

    # Run linting
    ruff check .

    # Fix auto-fixable issues
    ruff check --fix .

Docstring Linting
-----------------

We use **pydoclint** to ensure docstring quality and consistency:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Check docstring compliance
    pydoclint src/

    # Check specific files
    pydoclint src/sphinx_linkfix/specific_module.py

Pydoclint helps ensure that:

- All public functions and classes have docstrings
- Docstrings follow the NumPy format consistently
- Function signatures match their docstring parameters
- Return values are properly documented

Type Checking
-------------

We use **Pyright** for static type checking:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run type checking
    pyright

    # Check specific files
    pyright src/sphinx_linkfix/specific_module.py

Pyright is configured in ``pyrightconfig.json`` and helps catch type-related errors before runtime.

**Important**: You should link your conda environment path in ``pyrightconfig.local.json`` for proper type checking. Create this file if it doesn't exist:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "venvPath": "/path/to/your/conda/envs",
        "venv": "sphinx-linkfix"
    }

Replace ``/path/to/your/conda/envs`` with your actual conda environments path (e.g., ``/home/username/miniconda3/envs`` or ``/home/username/micromamba/envs``).

Make sure your code passes type checking before submitting a pull request.

Pre-commit Hooks
----------------

We use **pre-commit** to automatically run all code quality checks before each commit:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install pre-commit hooks (run once after cloning)
    pre-commit install

    # Run pre-commit on all files manually
    pre-commit run --all-files

    # Run pre-commit on staged files only
    pre-commit run

    # Update pre-commit hooks to latest versions
    pre-commit autoupdate

Pre-commit automatically runs the following tools on your code:

- **pyupgrade**: Modernizes Python syntax
- **docformatter**: Formats docstrings consistently
- **ruff**: Lints and formats code
- **pydoclint**: Checks docstring quality
- **pyright**: Performs type checking

**Configuration**: You can customize which tools run by editing ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``:

- **Comment out tools** to make pre-commit less restrictive (e.g., comment out pyright for faster commits)
- **Uncomment additional hooks** for more thorough checking
- **Adjust tool arguments** to match your preferences

**Note**: Even if you skip certain pre-commit checks locally, all tools will still be enforced in the CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions. This ensures code quality while allowing flexibility during development.

Code Style Guidelines
---------------------

- **Line length**: 100 characters maximum
- **Docstring style**: NumPy format
- **Import sorting**: Follow the black profile
- **Type hints**: Use type hints for function signatures
- **Variable naming**: Use descriptive names in snake_case

Example of well-formatted code:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    from sphinx_linkfix import fun

    def calculate_statistics(data: List[float]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate basic statistics for a list of numbers.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : List[float]
            List of numerical values.

        Returns
        -------
        Dict[str, float]
            Dictionary containing mean, median, and standard deviation.
        """
        if not data:
            return {"mean": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "std_dev": 0.0}

        mean = np.mean(data)
        median = np.median(data)
        std_dev = np.std(data)

        return {"mean": mean, "median": median, "std_dev": std_dev}

Testing
=======

We use **pytest** for testing. Tests are located in the ``tests/`` directory.

Running Tests
-------------

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run all tests
    pytest

    # Run tests with coverage
    pytest --cov=src

    # Run specific test file
    pytest tests/sphinx_linkfix/test_specific_module.py

    # Run tests matching a pattern
    pytest -k "test_pattern"

Writing Tests
-------------

- Place tests in the ``tests/`` directory, mirroring the ``src/`` structure
- Test file names should start with ``test_``
- Test function names should start with ``test_``
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate

Example test:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest
    import numpy as np

    from sphinx_linkfix import fun


    class TestFeature:
        """Test suite for new feature."""

        def test_feature_initialization(self):
            """Test that the feature initializes with correct default values."""
            assert fun()


Documentation
=============

We use **Sphinx** with **autoapi** for documentation generation.

Building Documentation
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    cd docs
    make html

The built documentation will be in ``docs/_build/html/``.

Writing Documentation
---------------------

- Use NumPy-style docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Update relevant ``.rst`` files in the ``docs/`` directory
- Include examples in docstrings when helpful
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Documentation links should be relative and use the GitHub format (e.g., `Name <NAME.rst>`_)

Submitting Changes
==================

Pull Request Process
--------------------

1. Rebase your feature branch on the latest dev branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Fetch the latest changes from upstream
    git fetch origin

    # Rebase your feature branch on dev
    git rebase origin/dev

    # If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue
    git add .
    git rebase --continue

2. Ensure your code passes all tests and linting:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run the full test suite
    pytest

    # Run all pre-commit hooks (formatting, linting, type checking, etc.)
    pre-commit run --all-files

3. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages:

.. code-block:: bash

    git add .
