Name of package: graphs_jackWheelerEng

Purpose: 
This package provides two core modules:
1. `heapq.py` – a custom implementation of a binary heap priority queue.
2. `sp.py` – shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra) built on top of the heap.

The main purpose of this package is to demonstrate an implementation of the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm.

Usage: 
Example: Finding the shortest path in a weighted graph

```python
from sp import dijkstra
