        **Note for Maintainers:**
        - Features should align with the SDK's core purpose of interfacing with Itential Platform and Gateway
        - Consider backward compatibility and API design consistency
        - Evaluate impact on dependencies and project complexity
        - Check GPL-3.0-or-later license compatibility for any new dependencies
