# Neuroglia Python Framework

Neuroglia is a lightweight, opinionated framework built on top of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that provides a comprehensive set of tools and patterns for building clean, maintainable, and scalable microservices. It enforces architectural best practices and provides out-of-the-box implementations of common patterns.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🏗️ Clean Architecture**: Enforces separation of concerns with clearly defined layers (API, Application, Domain, Integration)
- **💉 Dependency Injection**: Lightweight container with automatic service discovery and registration
- **🎯 CQRS & Mediation**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation with built-in mediator pattern
- **📡 Event-Driven Architecture**: Native support for CloudEvents, event sourcing, and reactive programming
- **🎯 Resource Oriented Architecture**: Declarative resource management with watchers, controllers, and reconciliation loops
- **🔌 MVC Controllers**: Class-based API controllers with automatic discovery and OpenAPI generation
- **🗄️ Repository Pattern**: Flexible data access layer with support for MongoDB, Event Store, and in-memory repositories
- **📊 Object Mapping**: Bidirectional mapping between domain models and DTOs
- **⚡ Reactive Programming**: Built-in support for RxPy and asynchronous event handling
- **🔧 12-Factor Compliance**: Implements all [12-Factor App](https://12factor.net) principles
- **📝 Rich Serialization**: JSON serialization with advanced features

## 🎯 Architecture Overview

Neuroglia promotes a clean, layered architecture that separates concerns and makes your code more maintainable:

## 🔧 Quick Start

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install neuroglia

# Or install from source
git clone <repository-url>
cd pyneuro
pip install -e .
```

Create your first application:

```python
from neuroglia.hosting.web import WebApplicationBuilder

# Create and configure the application
builder = WebApplicationBuilder()
builder.add_controllers(["api.controllers"])

# Build and run
app = builder.build()
app.use_controllers()
app.run()
```

## 🧪 Testing

Neuroglia includes a comprehensive test suite covering all framework features with both unit and integration tests.

### Running Tests

#### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run the complete test suite
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=neuroglia --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Run in parallel for faster execution
pytest -n auto
```

#### Run Specific Test Categories

```bash
# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Run only integration tests  
pytest tests/integration/

# Run tests by marker
pytest -m "unit"
pytest -m "integration"

### Test Organization

```text
tests/
├── unit/              # 🔬 Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/       # 🔗 Integration tests for workflows
├── fixtures/          # 🛠️ Shared test fixtures and utilities
└── conftest.py       # ⚙️ pytest configuration
```

### What's Tested

- Basic dependency injection service registration and resolution
- CQRS command and query handling through the mediator
- Object mapping between different types
- Repository pattern with various backend implementations
- Full framework integration workflows

### Test Fixtures

We provide comprehensive test fixtures for:

- Dependency injection container setup
- Sample services and repositories
- Mock data and test entities
- Configuration and settings

### Known Test Limitations

- Some dependency injection features (like strict service lifetimes) may have implementation-specific behavior
- MongoDB integration tests require a running MongoDB instance
- Event Store tests require EventStoreDB connection

### Adding Tests

When contributing, please include tests for new features:

```python
import pytest
from neuroglia.dependency_injection import ServiceCollection

class TestNewFeature:
    
    @pytest.mark.unit
    def test_my_unit_feature(self):
        """Test individual component"""
        result = self.service.do_something()
        assert result == expected_value
```
