# 📚 KizamuManga  ![State](https://img.shields.io/badge/state-development-yellow) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

**KizamuManga** is a command-line tool to **search, download, and convert manga chapters into CBZ files** from different online sources.

## ✨ Main Features

- 🔎 **Interactive search** for manga and chapter selection directly from the terminal.
- ⚡ **Asynchronous downloads** with concurrency control, automatic CBZ export, and cleanup of temporary files.
- 🖼️ **Optional image processing**: grayscale conversion, margin cropping, and proportional resizing.
- 🌐 **Multi-source support** (WeebCentral, InManga, and LeerMangaEsp) with an extensible scraping system based on Playwright.
- 📊 **Progress indicators and rotating logs** for easy tracking of execution.
  ##⚡Quick Start

1. Clone the repository and enter the project folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoceraCia/KizamuManga.git
```

2. Enter the project repo

```bash
cd KizamuManga
```

3. install requirements and playwright browsers

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && playwright install
```

4. start searching or installing a manga

```bash
python -m kizamumanga.main search "One Piece"
python -m kizamumanga.main install "One Piece"
```

## 🧾 Requirements

- Python **3.9 or higher**.
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Playwright installed along with its browsers (`playwright install`).
- Access to the supported websites to fetch online chapters.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository and enter the project folder.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install Playwright browsers: `playwright install`

## 🔧 Configuration

The `config.toml` file (at the project root) allows customization of parameters such as:

| Key                    | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cbz_path`           | Destination folder for CBZ files (default:`manga_downloads`).  |
| `website`            | Active source (`weeb_central`, `inmanga`, `leermangaesp`). |
| `multiple_tasks`     | Maximum number of concurrent downloads.                          |
| `color`              | Export in color (`true`) or grayscale (`false`).             |
| `cropping_mode`      | Enable automatic margin cropping.                                |
| `width` / `height` | Target resolution; leave empty to keep original size.            |

You can also modify configuration from the terminal:

- Change scraper and concurrency: `python -m kizamumanga.main config scraper --website inmanga --multiple_tasks 5`
- Change output folder: `python -m kizamumanga.main config paths --cbz_path "./my_manga"`
- Apply predefined resolution profile: `python -m kizamumanga.main config dimensions --device boox_go_7`

## 🕹️ Basic Usage

- Search for manga: `python -m kizamumanga.main search "One Piece"`
- Download all chapters: `python -m kizamumanga.main install "One Piece"`
- Download a specific chapter or range:
  - `python -m kizamumanga.main install "One Piece" 5`
  - `python -m kizamumanga.main install "One Piece" 10-15`
    CBZ files are saved in the folder defined by `cbz_path`.

## 🔄 Internal Workflow

1. The **Runner** validates arguments, loads configuration, and sets up the selected scraper.
2. Manga and chapter lists are fetched using **Playwright + BeautifulSoup**.
3. Each chapter is downloaded via `aiohttp`, optionally processed, and packed into a **CBZ**.
