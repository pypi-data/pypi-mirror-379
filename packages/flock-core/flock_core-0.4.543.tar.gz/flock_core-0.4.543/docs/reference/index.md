# API Reference ðŸ“š

This section contains low-level details for developers who need to dig into the public classes and functions.  If you are just *using* Flock, you probably don't need to read every line here â€“ the Guides and Core Concepts will cover most day-to-day tasks.

* [`FlockAgent`](flock_agent.md) â€“ Declarative agent class.
* `Flock` â€“ Orchestrator (coming soon â€“ autogenerated docs).
* `FlockContext`, `FlockRegistry`, evaluators, modules, routers â€“ TBD.

> **Note**: The reference pages are hand-written summaries today.  A Sphinx-based auto-generated site is on the roadmap (see [Contributing](../about/contributing.md)).
