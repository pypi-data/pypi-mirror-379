Make scripts with shebang executable in Windows by adding [shim](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/shim/).

</div>

## Usage
1. Install bangshim with [scoop](https://scoop.sh/)
```sh
scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winterreisender/bangshim/refs/heads/master/bangshim.json
```
or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
```sh
uv tool install bangshim
```
or pip
```sh
pip install bangshim
```
It's also recommended to install [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) for the `env` in shebang

2. Write any script with [shebang](https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/), supposing you have an intepreter (Git Bash, MSYS2, etc.) installed for your scripts.

```python
#!/usr/bin/sh
print("Hello World")
```

3. Make your script executable
```sh
bangshim ./myscript.sh
./myscript
# "Hello World"
```


## FAQ

1. Q: Why doing this?  
A: shebang is the Unix way for executable scripts, while shim are the best practice for Windows. And this is a tool to make the Unix style work in Windows. 


2. Q: How it works?  
A: bangshim do a simple things, search intepreter from shebang in `PATH`, and generate args for [shim](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/shim/).

3. Q: How to work with `/usr/bin/env` ?  
A: We suppose you installed an `env.exe` in your `PATH`. For example, you can install [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) by `scoop install uutils-coreutils`
