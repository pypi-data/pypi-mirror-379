"""A fast key-value storage library.

Scruby is a fast key-value storage asynchronous library that provides an
ordered mapping from string keys to string values.
The library uses fractal-tree addressing.

The database consists of collections.
The maximum size of the one collection is 16**8=4294967296 branches,
each branch can store one or more keys.

The value of any key in collection can be obtained in 8 steps,
thereby achieving high performance.

In the future, to search by value of key, the use of a quantum loop is supposed.
