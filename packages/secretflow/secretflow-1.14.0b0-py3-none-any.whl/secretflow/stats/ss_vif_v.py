    Calculate variance inflation factor for vertical slice dataset
    by using secret sharing.

    see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_inflation_factor

    For large dataset(large than 10w samples & 200 features)
    Recommend use [Ring size: 128, Fxp: 40] options for SPU device.

    NOTICE:
    The analytical solution of matrix inversion in secret sharing is very expensive,
    so this method uses Newton iteration to find approximate solution.

    When there is multicollinearity in the input dataset, the XTX matrix is not full rank,
    and the analytical solution for the inverse of the XTX matrix does not exist.

    The VIF results of these linear correlational columns calculated by statsmodels are INF,
    indicating that the correlation is infinite.
    However, this method will get a large VIF value (>>1000) on these columns,
    which can also correctly reflect the strong correlation of these columns.

    When there are constant columns in the data, the VIF result calculated by statsmodels is NAN,
    and the result of this method is also a large VIF value (>> 1000),
    means these columns need to be removed before training.

    Therefore, although the results of this method cannot be completely consistent with statemodels
    that calculations in plain text, but they can still correctly reflect the correlation of the input data columns.
