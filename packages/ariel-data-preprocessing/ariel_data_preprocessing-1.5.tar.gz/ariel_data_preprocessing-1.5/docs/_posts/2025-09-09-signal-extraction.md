title: "Signal Extraction: From 3D Spectrograms to 1D Time Series"
---

With the signal correction pipeline delivering clean, calibrated data, it's time to tackle the next challenge: extracting meaningful spectral signals from the AIRS-CH0 frames. The goal is to transform bulky 3D arrays into a focused 1D time series that capture the wavelength signals over time for each star.

Checkout the [AIRS-CH0 signal extraction notebook](https://github.com/gperdrizet/ariel-data-challenge/blob/main/notebooks/02.3-AIRS_signal_extraction.ipynb) on GitHub

## 1. The challenge

After signal correction, each planet's AIRS-CH0 data consists of thousands of frames, each containing a 32Ã—282 pixel spectrogram. But here's the key insight: not all detector pixels contain useful signal. The spectral data is concentrated in just a few rows where the dispersed starlight creates a distinct spectral trace.

The question becomes: how do we automatically identify and extract just the signal-bearing rows from each frame?

## 2. Intelligent signal extraction

The solution involves analyzing the signal strength across detector rows to identify the "spectral strip" - the handful of rows containing the actual dispersed spectrum:

</p>

The plot reveals the signal structure clearly: rows 14-17 contain the strongest signals. Outside of that narrow spatial band, the signal drops off quickly. This makes sense - the telescope's grism disperses starlight into a narrow horizontal band across the detector.

Rather than hardcoding row numbers (which might vary between planets), the extraction algorithm uses an adaptive threshold approach:

</p>

1. **Analyze signal strength**: Sum pixel values across each row in the first frame
2. **Apply inclusion threshold**: Select rows with signal above a configurable threshold (typically 75-95% of peak signal)
3. **Extract and sum**: Pull out the selected rows from all frames and sum them within each frame to create a 1D spectrum for each time point
4. **Optional smoothing**: Apply moving average filtering to each wavelength index across the frames to reduce noise

## 3. Extracted data

The results are impressive: the extracted signal strip shows exoplanet transits just as clearly as using the total frame flux, but with dramatically reduced data volume and a subjective reduction in outliers. Summing the brightest rows also reduces noise in the spectrum derived from each frame.

## 4. Performance impact

The signal extraction provides substantial benefits:

- **Data reduction**: From 9024 pixels per frame down to just 282 wavelength values (97% reduction)
- **Noise reduction**: Focusing on high-signal rows improves signal-to-noise ratio
- **Processing speed**: Smaller datasets mean faster downstream analysis
