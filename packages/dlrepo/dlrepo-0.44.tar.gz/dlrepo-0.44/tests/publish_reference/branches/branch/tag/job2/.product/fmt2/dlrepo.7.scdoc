dlrepo(7) "" "Administration Manual"

# NAME

*dlrepo* -- artifact repository administration

# DESCRIPTION

*dlrepo* is an artifact repository. It supports storing build artifacts (binary
packages, documentation, vm images, container images, etc.) in a structured
file system tree. It exposes an HTTP API to upload files, delete them, add
metadata, etc.

This manual describes how to administrate the server.

# CONFIGURATION

Before running the server, you must specify mandatory parameters in the
configuration file. See *dlrepo-config*(5) for more details.

The *dlrepo* daemon should be placed behind a proxy server. The recommended
proxy is *nginx*. An example configuration for nginx is available in
_/usr/share/doc/dlrepo/examples_. The default _dlrepo.socket_ unit should match
this configuration.

Be aware that user passwords are sent in clear text in HTTP request headers.
Use HTTPS unless you absolutely do not care about security and user
authentication.

Communication between the proxy server and the *dlrepo* daemon should be done
via UNIX sockets to minimize the risk of local eavesdropping.

# STARTING ON BOOT

By default, _dlrepo.socket_ should start on boot after installation. When
*nginx* accesses the socket for the first time, systemd will start
_dlrepo.service_ automatically and pass the socket to the python daemon.

# GARBAGE COLLECTION

*dlrepo-cleanup*(8) will remove tags that exceed any branch cleanup policy.
