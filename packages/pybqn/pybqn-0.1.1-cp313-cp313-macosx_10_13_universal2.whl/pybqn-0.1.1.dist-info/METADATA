# BQN‚ÜîNumPy bridge

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import bqn
>>> bqn.bqn('{(+¬¥√∑‚â†)Àò7‚Üïùï©}',np.arange(0,10,dtype=np.int32))
array([3, 4, 5, 6], dtype=int8)
>>> bqn.bqn('¬Ø1‚äë(1‚ä∏+‚•ä+)‚óã‚â†(‚åä`‚ä¢‚åä‚äè‚ä∏¬ª‚àò‚ä¢-0‚àæ1+‚ä£)Àù=‚åú‚üú‚åΩ',"kitten","sitting")
3.0
```

## Installation

Install the BQN C library, `libcbqn.so` (`libcbqn.dylib` on Mac) to `/usr/local/lib`, and headers. Then:

```
pip3 install pybqn
```

## Limitations

- Only supports integer and floating-point types.
- Can't marshal Python integer scalars to BQN.
- Doesn't marshal BQN strings to Python
