White  dwarf evolutionary  tracks  resulting   from  low-metallicity
progenitors.   In  the  .tar.gz  file, three  folders,  one  for  each
metallicity,  Z=0.0001, 0.0005  and  0.00003, are  found.  The  number
labeling each file indicates the white dwarf stellar mass.

For each file it is listed from left to right:


Log L: The logarithm of the surface luminosity in solar unit;

Log Teff: The logarithm of the effective temperature (K);

Tc: The logarithm of the central temperature (K) (millon degree);

rho_c: The logarithm of the central density (gr/cm3);

Hc: central H abundance

He: central He abundance

cons: outer convection zone

conc: inner convection zone

log (edad/Myr): The logarithm of the total age in millon years counted from the ZAMS (
i.e. the age of progenitor star is included);

Masa: Stellar mass in solar unit;

...

Log Lpp: The logarithm of luminosity (in solar unit) due to proton-proton burning;

Log Lcno: The logarithm of luminosity (in solar unit) due to CNO burning;

Log LHe: The logarithm of luminosity (in solar unit) due to helium burning;

....

Log Lnu: The logarithm of luminosity (in solar unit) due to neutrino losses;

Log MHtot: The logarithm of the hydrogen content in solar mass;

....

Log(grav): The logarithm of surface gravity (cm/s2);

R/R_sun: Stellar radius en solar unit.
