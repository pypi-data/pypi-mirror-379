Sloan Digital Sky Survey filters:

CO-WD sequences with masses 0.3515, 0.3844, 0.3986, 0.4160 and 0.4481
M_sun.  Ages are counted from the end of mass transfer. Only the evolutionary
stages corresponding to the final cooling branch are shown. For each file,
it is listed from left to right:

Teff: effective temperature

log g: logarithm_10 of gravity (cm/s**2)

log L/Lo: logarithm_10 of luminosity (in solar units)

Age: age in Gyr
