### The Zero-Boilerplate Python Framework for Rapid API Development

![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jetio?style=for-the-badge)

**Jetio** is a modern, high-performance Python web framework designed to transform your SQLAlchemy models directly into fully-featured, production-ready REST APIs with minimal code. Stop writing boilerplate and start building what matters.

---

## Key Features

* **Model-Driven APIs:** Use standard SQLAlchemy models as your single source of truth for your database, validation, and API serialization.
* **Automatic CRUD:** Instantly generate robust Create, Read, Update, and Delete endpoints for any model with a single line of code.
* **Secure by Design:** Easily secure your auto-generated endpoints with a single flag and plug in your own authentication logic.
* **Async First:** Built from the ground up on an async core (powered by Starlette) for maximum performance and scalability.
* **Automatic Docs:** Get interactive Swagger UI and ReDoc API documentation out of the box.
* **Flexible & Familiar:** Escape the generator whenever you need to. Use familiar decorator-based routing for custom endpoints, giving you the best of both worlds.
