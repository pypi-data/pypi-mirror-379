"""
Encapsulates results of various database operations including delete, update, insert, and replace.

The module defines specialized classes for operation results, providing detailed insights
into the execution of common database actions. Each class represents a specific type of
database action and provides structured access to the results, including the count of records affected
and any associated raw data.
