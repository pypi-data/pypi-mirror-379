## Installation

The easiest way to install the `fractal-feature-explorer` is to use `uv` or `pipx`:

```bash
pipx install fractal-feature-explorer
```

or

```bash
uv tool install fractal-feature-explorer
```

Alternatively, you can install it in a standart Conda/Venv using `pip`:

```bash
pip install fractal-feature-explorer
```

## Usage

You can run the dashboard using the `explorer` command:

```bash
explorer
```

at the first run, it will ask you for permission to create a configuration file in your home directory (`~/.fractal_feature_explorer/config.toml`), which will be used for future runs.

Alternatively, you can expose a configuration file using the `FRACTAL_FEATURE_EXPLORER_CONFIG` environment variable:

```bash
export FRACTAL_FEATURE_EXPLORER_CONFIG=/path/to/config.toml
explorer
```

More details on the configuration file will be availble soon.

## Local development setup

- pixi (lockfile create with pixi 0.47)
- local clone of this repo

## running the dashboard

- using pixi task

    ```bash
    pixi run -e dev explorer-dev
    ```

- from streamlit directly

    ```bash
    pixi run streamlit run src/fractal_feature_explorer/main.py
    ```

## Change log

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details on changes and updates.

## URL query parameters

- `setup_mode`: either `Plates` or `Images`. This will determine the setup page of the dashboard.
- `zarr_url`: the URL of the zarr file to load.
- `token`: the fractal token to use for authentication (optional).

example URL: `http://localhost:8501/?zarr_url=/Users/locerr/data/20200812-23well&?zarr_url=/Users/locerr/data/20200811-23well`

## Main limitations

- Image preview is not available for 3D images.
- Single images not supported, only plates.

## Troubleshooting

- pixi lock file not supported by your local pixi version:

    ```bash
    $ pixi run explorer
    × Failed to load lock file from `/xxx/fractal-feature-explorer/pixi.lock`
    ╰─▶ found newer lockfile format version 6, but only up to including version 5 is supported
    ```

    If you get an error like this you need to either update your local pixi version (`pixi self-update`) or create a new lock file with your local version of pixi. To do this, delete the `pixi.lock`, a new lock will be created when your run the dashboard again.

## Contributing

Releasing a new version on PyPI:

1. Create a new local tag with the format `vX.Y.Z`, where `X.Y.Z` is the new version number.

    ```bash
    git tag v0.1.8 -m "v0.1.8"
    ```

2. Push the tag to the remote repository.

    ```bash
    git push --tags
    ```
