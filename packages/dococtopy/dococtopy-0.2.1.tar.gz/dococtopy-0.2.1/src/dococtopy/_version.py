"""Version information for DocOctopy.

This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the DocOctopy version.
All other version references throughout the codebase should import from here.

IMPORTANT: Do not edit this file manually!
Use the version management commands instead:

    uv run task version:show           # Show current version
    uv run task version:bump:patch     # Bump patch version (0.2.1 → 0.2.2)
    uv run task version:bump:minor    # Bump minor version (0.2.1 → 0.3.0)
    uv run task version:bump:major    # Bump major version (0.2.1 → 1.0.0)
    uv run task version:set 1.0.0     # Set specific version

The version management system automatically updates:
- This file (single source of truth)
- All test files that check version output
- All components that import __version__
- Build metadata for packaging

Version Format: Semantic Versioning (X.Y.Z)
- X: Major version (breaking changes)
- Y: Minor version (new features, backward compatible)
- Z: Patch version (bug fixes, backward compatible)
