# AWS Clients Python Library
This library is a collection of client helper functions that I have found useful when working with AWS services. The library is written in Python and is intended to be used in Python projects. The library is not intended to be a comprehensive library for all AWS services, but rather a collection of helper functions that I have found useful when working with AWS services.

The library includes support for:
+ **Lambda**
+ **Secrets Manager**
+ **Systems Manager Parameter Store**

> **Note:** _This library is in active development and is subject to change.  It covers only the methods I have needed so far.  If you need a method that is not covered, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request._
