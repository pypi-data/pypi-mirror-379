# codelogic-mcp-server

An [MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) to utilize Codelogic's rich software dependency data in your AI programming assistant.

## Components

### Tools

The server implements two tools:

- **codelogic-method-impact**: Pulls an impact assessment from the CodeLogic server's APIs for your code.
  - Takes the given "method" that you're working on and its associated "class".
- **codelogic-database-impact**: Analyzes impacts between code and database entities.
  - Takes the database entity type (column, table, or view) and its name.

### Install

#### Pre Requisites

The MCP server relies upon Astral UV to run, please [install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### MacOS Workaround for uvx

There is a known issue with `uvx` on **MacOS** where the CodeLogic MCP server may fail to launch in certain IDEs (such as Cursor), resulting in errors like:
See [issue #11](https://github.com/CodeLogicIncEngineering/codelogic-mcp-server/issues/11)
```
Failed to connect client closed
```

This appears to be a problem with Astral `uvx` running on MacOS. The following can be used as a workaround:

1. Clone this project locally.
2. Configure your `mcp.json` to use `uv` instead of `uvx`. For example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codelogic-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<PATH_TO_UV>/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<PATH_TO_THIS_REPO>/codelogic-mcp-server-main",
        "run",
        "codelogic-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CODELOGIC_SERVER_HOST": "<url to the server e.g. https://myco.app.codelogic.com>",
        "CODELOGIC_USERNAME": "<my username>",
        "CODELOGIC_PASSWORD": "<my password>",
        "CODELOGIC_WORKSPACE_NAME": "<my workspace>",
        "CODELOGIC_DEBUG_MODE": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Cursor.
4. Ensure the Cursor Global Rule for CodeLogic is in place.
5. Open the MCP tab in Cursor and refresh the `codelogic-mcp-server`.
6. Ask Cursor to make a code change in an existing class. The MCP server should now run the impact analysis successfully.

## Configuration for Different IDEs

### Visual Studio Code Configuration

To configure this MCP server in VS Code:

1. First, ensure you have GitHub Copilot agent mode enabled in VS Code.

2. Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "codelogic-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "codelogic-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CODELOGIC_SERVER_HOST": "<url to the server e.g. https://myco.app.codelogic.com>",
        "CODELOGIC_USERNAME": "<my username>",
        "CODELOGIC_PASSWORD": "<my password>",
        "CODELOGIC_WORKSPACE_NAME": "<my workspace>",
        "CODELOGIC_DEBUG_MODE": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** On some systems, you may need to use the full path to the uvx executable instead of just "uvx". For example: `/home/user/.local/bin/uvx` on Linux/Mac or `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\astral\uvx.exe` on Windows.

3. Alternatively, you can run the `MCP: Add Server` command from the Command Palette and provide the server information.

4. To manage your MCP servers, use the `MCP: List Servers` command from the Command Palette.

5. Once configured, the server's tools will be available to Copilot agent mode. You can toggle specific tools on/off as needed by clicking the Tools button in the Chat view when in agent mode.

6. To use the Codelogic tools in agent mode, you can specifically ask about code impacts or database relationships, and the agent will utilize the appropriate tools.

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Configure Claude Desktop by editing the configuration file:

- On MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- On Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following to your configuration file:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "codelogic-mcp-server": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "codelogic-mcp-server@latest"
    ],
    "env": {
      "CODELOGIC_SERVER_HOST": "<url to the server e.g. https://myco.app.codelogic.com>",
      "CODELOGIC_USERNAME": "<my username>",
      "CODELOGIC_PASSWORD": "<my password>",
      "CODELOGIC_WORKSPACE_NAME": "<my workspace>"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** On some systems, you may need to use the full path to the uvx executable instead of just "uvx". For example: `/home/user/.local/bin/uvx` on Linux/Mac or `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\astral\uvx.exe` on Windows.

After adding the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes.

### Windsurf IDE Configuration

To run this MCP server with [Windsurf IDE](https://codeium.com/windsurf):

**Configure Windsurf IDE**:

To configure Windsurf IDE, you need to create or modify the `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` configuration file.

Add the following configuration to your file:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "codelogic-mcp-server": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "codelogic-mcp-server@latest"
    ],

      "CODELOGIC_USERNAME": "<my username>",
      "CODELOGIC_PASSWORD": "<my password>",
      "CODELOGIC_WORKSPACE_NAME": "<my workspace>"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** On some systems, you may need to use the full path to the uvx executable instead of just "uvx". For example: `/home/user/.local/bin/uvx` on Linux/Mac or `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\astral\uvx.exe` on Windows.

After adding the configuration, restart Windsurf IDE or refresh the tools to apply the changes.

### Cursor Configuration

1. Configure the MCP server by creating a `.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codelogic-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "codelogic-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {

```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured to customize the behavior of the server:

- `CODELOGIC_SERVER_HOST`: The URL of the CodeLogic server.
- `CODELOGIC_USERNAME`: Your CodeLogic username.
- `CODELOGIC_PASSWORD`: Your CodeLogic password.
- `CODELOGIC_WORKSPACE_NAME`: The name of the workspace to use.
- `CODELOGIC_DEBUG_MODE`: Set to `true` to enable debug mode. When enabled, additional debug files such as `timing_log.txt` and `impact_data*.json` will be generated. Defaults to `false`.

### Example Configuration

```json
"env": {
  "CODELOGIC_SERVER_HOST": "<url to the server e.g. https://myco.app.codelogic.com>",
  "CODELOGIC_USERNAME": "<my username>",
  "CODELOGIC_PASSWORD": "<my password>",
  "CODELOGIC_WORKSPACE_NAME": "<my workspace>",
  "CODELOGIC_DEBUG_MODE": "true"
}
```

### Pinning the version

instead of using the **latest** version of the server, you can pin to a specific version by changing the **args** field to match the version in [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/codelogic-mcp-server/) e.g.

```json
    "args": [
      "codelogic-mcp-server@0.2.2"
    ],
```

### Version Compatibility

This MCP server has the following version compatibility requirements:

- Version 0.3.1 and below: Compatible with all CodeLogic API versions
- Version 0.4.0 and above: Requires CodeLogic API version 25.10.0 or greater

If you're upgrading, make sure your CodeLogic server meets the minimum API version requirement.

## Debug Logging

When `CODELOGIC_DEBUG_MODE=true`, debug files are written to the system temporary directory:

- **Windows**: `%TEMP%\codelogic-mcp-server` (typically `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Temp\codelogic-mcp-server`)
- **macOS**: `/tmp/codelogic-mcp-server` (or `$TMPDIR/codelogic-mcp-server` if set)  
- **Linux**: `/tmp/codelogic-mcp-server` (or `$TMPDIR/codelogic-mcp-server` if set)

**Debug files include**:
- `timing_log.txt` - Performance timing information
- `impact_data_*.json` - Raw impact analysis data for troubleshooting

**Finding your log directory**:
```python
import tempfile
import os
print("Log directory:", os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), "codelogic-mcp-server"))
```

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

The project uses unittest for testing. You can run unit tests without any external dependencies:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s test -p "unit_*.py"
```

Unit tests use mock data and don't require a connection to a CodeLogic server.

### Integration Tests (Optional)

If you want to run integration tests that connect to a real CodeLogic server:

1. Copy `test/.env.test.example` to `test/.env.test` and populate with your CodeLogic server details
2. Run the integration tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s test -p "integration_*.py"
```

Note: Integration tests require access to a CodeLogic server instance.
