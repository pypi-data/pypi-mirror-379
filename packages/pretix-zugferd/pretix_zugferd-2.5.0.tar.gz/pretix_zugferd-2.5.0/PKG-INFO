ZUGFeRD invoices for pretix
===========================

This is a plugin for `pretix`_. It allows you to attach ZUGFeRD information to your invoices.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Use this plugin at your own risk. If there is a semantic difference between the XML and PDF contents in
your ZUGFeRD invoices, you might legally owe the VAT to the financial authorities **twice**, since you then generated two
invoices. We tried our best to avoid this, but we do not assume any liability. Please check the output of this plugin
with your tax or legal attorney before use.

Installation note
-----------------

This plugin requires ``ghostscript`` to be installed. If you have it installed in a nonstandard location, you can
specify it in your ``pretix.cfg``::
