### hydragram

**Hydragram is an enhanced filter and handler system inspired by Pyrogram, built on top of pyrogram.**

**It helps you avoid common Pyrogram errors‚Äîespecially those related to using `group={}` in command handlers‚Äîby providing a simple and stable way to register commands and filters.**

**With Hydragram, you no longer need to manually manage the `group` parameter or worry about filter conflicts. It handles all that smoothly for you, so your commands work reliably every time.**

**Simplify your Telegram bot development and enjoy clean, easy-to-use decorators and filters designed for real-world use.**

### Testing Bot
[Yumeko](https://t.me/Yumeko_ProXBot) *That is running on telegram by the last code of that Readme check it out*

[Toji](https://t.me/Toji_ProXBot) *That is running on telegram with Another repo where this package used check it also*

## Installation

```bash
pip install hydragram

```
### How to use it

```python
from hydragram.client import Client
from hydragram.handler import handler
from hydragram.filters import command, group

client = Client("mybot", api_id=12345, api_hash="xyz", bot_token="TOKEN")

@handler("start")
async def start(client, message):
    await message.reply_text("Hello!")

# <======== YOU CAN ALSO USE IT IN ANOTHER WAY =====>
@client.on_message(filters.command("start"))
async def start(client, message):
    await message.reply_text("Hello this is second way!")

client.run()
```


### Example How to use them 
```python
from hydragram import Client
from hydragram.filters import setup 
from hydragram.handler import handler
from hydragram.filters import group, private
from pyrogram.types import Message

app = Client(
    "TestBot",
    api_id=You_Api_Id, # generate it from my.telegram.org
    api_hash="Your_Api_hash", # generate it from my.telegram.org
    bot_token="Your_Bot_Token" # Get from @BotFather
)

# Initialize with your settings
setup(
    OWNER_ID=6346273488,  # Replace Your user ID and generate from @Raiden_Robot
    DEV_USERS=[8171988347, 5907205317],  # Your dev team Id and generate Their I'd from @Raiden_Robot
    PREFIX_HANDLER=["/", "!" "Raiden ", "raiden "],  # Command prefixes
    BOT_USERNAME="@Raiden_Robot"  # Your bot's username

# Regular command (anyone can use)
@handler("start", extra=private)
async def start_handler(_, m: Message):
    await m.reply("Hello! I'm alive ‚úÖ")

# Group command
@handler("alive", extra=group)
async def alive(_, m: Message):

# Combined permission example
@handler("power", dev_cmd=True, gc_admin=True)
async def power_command(_, m: Message):
