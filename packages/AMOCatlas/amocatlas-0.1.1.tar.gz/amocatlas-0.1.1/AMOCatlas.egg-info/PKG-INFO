**Clean, modular loading of AMOC observing array datasets, with optional structured logging and metadata enrichment.**

AMOCatlas provides a unified system to access and process data from major Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) observing arrays. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is a critical component of Earth's climate system, transporting heat northward in the Atlantic Ocean. This project enables researchers to easily access, analyze, and visualize data from key monitoring stations.

This is a work in progress, all contributions welcome!

## Features

- 🌊 **Unified Data Access**: Single interface for multiple AMOC observing arrays
- 📊 **Automatic Data Download**: Intelligent caching system prevents redundant downloads
- 📝 **Structured Logging**: Per-dataset logging for reproducible workflows
- 🔍 **Metadata Enrichment**: Enhanced datasets with processing timestamps and source information
- 📈 **Visualization Tools**: Built-in plotting functions with consistent styling
- 🧪 **Sample Datasets**: Quick access to example data for testing and development

## Supported Arrays

| Array | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **RAPID** | 26°N | Continuous monitoring since 2004 |
| **MOVE** | 16°N | Meridional heat transport |
| **OSNAP** | Subpolar North Atlantic | Overturning circulation |
| **SAMBA** | 34.5°S | South Atlantic MOC |
| **MOCHA** | Various | Historical datasets |
| **41°N** | 41°N | North Atlantic section |
| **DSO** | Denmark Strait | Overflow monitoring |

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install AMOCatlas
```

**Requirements**: Python ≥3.9, with numpy, pandas, xarray, and matplotlib.

### For Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMOCcommunity/amocatlas.git
cd amocatlas
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```

This installs amocatlas locally. The `-e` ensures that any edits you make in the files will be picked up by scripts that import functions from amocatlas.

## Quick Start

### Load Sample Data
```python
from amocatlas import readers

# Load RAPID sample dataset
ds = readers.load_sample_dataset("rapid")
print(ds)
```

### Load Full Datasets
```python
from amocatlas import readers

# Load complete dataset (downloads and caches data)
datasets = readers.load_dataset("osnap")
for ds in datasets:
    print(ds)
```

A `*.log` file will be written to `logs/` by default.

Data will be cached in `~/.amocatlas_data/` unless you specify a custom location.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [https://amoccommunity.github.io/amocatlas](https://amoccommunity.github.io/amocatlas/).

Check out the demo notebook `notebooks/demo.ipynb` for example functionality.

## Development

### Running Tests
All new functions should include tests. You can run tests locally and generate a coverage report with:
```bash
pytest --cov=amocatlas --cov-report term-missing tests/
```

Try to ensure that all the lines of your contribution are covered in the tests.

### Code Quality
```bash
black amocatlas/ tests/          # Format code
ruff check amocatlas/ tests/     # Lint code
pre-commit run --all-files       # Run all hooks
```

### Working with Notebooks
You can run the example jupyter notebook by launching jupyterlab with `jupyter-lab` and navigating to the `notebooks` directory, or in VS Code or another python GUI.

### Documentation
To build the documentation locally you need to install a few extra requirements:

- Install `make` for your computer, e.g. on ubuntu with `sudo apt install make`
- Install the additional python requirements. Activate the environment you use for working with amocatlas, navigate to the top directory of this repo, then run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

Once you have the extras installed, you can build the docs locally by navigating to the `docs/` directory and running `make clean html`. This command will create a directory called `build/` which contains the html files of the documentation. Open the file `docs/build/html/index.html` in your browser, and you will see the docs with your changes applied.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add test coverage for utilities and readers
- [ ] Add dataset summary output at end of load_dataset()
- [x] Optional global logging helpers (disable_logging(), enable_logging())
- [ ] Extend load_sample_dataset() to support all arrays
- [x] Metadata enrichment (source paths, processing dates)
- [ ] Clarify separation between added metadata and original metadata

## Initial Plans

The **initial plan** for this repository is to simply load the volume transports as published by different AMOC observing arrays and replicate (update) the figure from Frajka-Williams et al. (2019) [10.3389/fmars.2019.00260](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00260).
