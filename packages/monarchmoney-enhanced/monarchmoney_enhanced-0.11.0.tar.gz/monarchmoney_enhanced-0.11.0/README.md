# Installation

## From Source Code

Clone this repository from Git

`git clone https://github.com/keithah/monarchmoney-enhanced.git`

## Via `pip`

`pip install monarchmoney-enhanced`

**Note**: This package is published as `monarchmoney-enhanced` on PyPI to distinguish it from the original `monarchmoney` package while maintaining the same Python import structure.
# Instantiate & Login

There are two ways to use this library: interactive and non-interactive.

## Interactive

If you're using this library in something like iPython or Jupyter, you can run an interactive-login which supports multi-factor authentication:

```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney

mm = MonarchMoney()
await mm.interactive_login()
```
This will prompt you for the email, password and, if needed, the multi-factor token.

## Non-interactive

For a non-interactive session, you'll need to create an instance and login:

```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney

mm = MonarchMoney()
await mm.login(email, password)
```

This may throw a `RequireMFAException`.  If it does, you'll need to get a multi-factor token and call the following method:

```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney, RequireMFAException

mm = MonarchMoney()
try:
        await mm.login(email, password)
except RequireMFAException:
        await mm.multi_factor_authenticate(email, password, multi_factor_code)
```

**Note**: The library automatically detects whether your MFA code is an email OTP (6 digits) or TOTP from an authenticator app, and uses the appropriate authentication field.

Alternatively, you can provide the MFA Secret Key. The MFA Secret Key is found when setting up the MFA in Monarch Money by going to Settings -> Security -> Enable MFA -> and copy the "Two-factor text code". Then provide it in the login() method:
```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney, RequireMFAException

mm = MonarchMoney()
await mm.login(
        email=email,
        password=password,
        save_session=False,
        use_saved_session=False,
        mfa_secret_key=mfa_secret_key,
    )

```

# Use a Saved Session

You can easily save your session for use later on.  While we don't know precisely how long a session lasts, authors of this library have found it can last several months.

## Secure Session Storage

Sessions are stored using **AES-256 encryption** for security. The enhanced package ensures session persistence works reliably across processes and application restarts.

```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney, RequireMFAException

mm = MonarchMoney()
mm.interactive_login()

# Save it for later, no more need to login!
mm.save_session()
```

Once you've logged in, you can simply load the saved session to pick up where you left off.

```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney, RequireMFAException

mm = MonarchMoney()
mm.load_session()  # Works across processes and app restarts!

# Then, start accessing data!
await mm.get_accounts()
```

# Contributing

Any and all contributions -- code, documentation, feature requests, feedback -- are welcome!

If you plan to submit up a pull request, you can expect a timely review.  Please ensure you do the following:

  - Configure your IDE or manually run [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to auto-format the code.
  - Ensure you run the unit tests in this project: `pytest`
    
Actions are configured in this repo to run against all PRs and merges which will block them if a unit test fails or Black throws an error.

# Troubleshooting

## Authentication Issues

If you're experiencing login problems, this fork includes several fixes:

**404 Login Errors**: The library automatically falls back to GraphQL authentication if REST endpoints return 404.

**403 Forbidden Errors**: Ensure you're using the latest version which includes proper browser headers (device-uuid, Origin, User-Agent).

**MFA Problems**: The library automatically detects email OTP vs authenticator app codes:
- 6-digit numeric codes are treated as email OTP
- Other formats are treated as TOTP from authenticator apps

**Rate Limiting**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff handles temporary rate limits automatically.

# FAQ

**How do I use this API if I login to Monarch via Google?**

If you currently use Google or 'Continue with Google' to access your Monarch account, you'll need to set a password to leverage this API.  You can set a password on your Monarch account by going to your [security settings](https://app.monarchmoney.com/settings/security).  

Don't forget to use a password unique to your Monarch account and to enable multi-factor authentication!
