mm = OptimizedMonarchMoney(
    cache_enabled=True,
    deduplicate_requests=True,
    cache_ttl_overrides={"GetAccounts": 600}
)

# Works exactly like MonarchMoney
await mm.login(email, password)  
accounts = await mm.get_accounts()

# Check performance improvements
metrics = mm.get_cache_metrics()
print(f"Cache hit rate: {metrics['cache_hit_rate']}")
print(f"API calls saved: {metrics['api_calls_saved']}")
```
