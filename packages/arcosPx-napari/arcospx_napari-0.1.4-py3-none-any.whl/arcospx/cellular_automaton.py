"""
The Cellular automaton follows the rules outlined below:

This cellular automaton simulates wave propagation on a 2D grid. The behavior of each cell at every time step is 
determined by its state, the states of its neighboring cells, and a set of probabilistic rules. The automaton 
evolves over discrete time steps, updating the grid according to the following rules:

1. Grid Representation
    - Grid (`grid`): Represents the activity of each cell, with a non-zero value indicating active cells and a zero 
      value indicating inactive cells.
    - Refractory Grid (`refractory_grid`): Tracks the refractory period of each cell, which prevents reactivation 
      during this period.
    - Lifetime Grid (`lifetime_grid`): Records the number of time steps each cell has been continuously active.
    - Wave ID Grid (`wave_id_grid`): Assigns a unique ID to each wave, allowing tracking of individual wave fronts 
      across the grid.

2. Cell State Updates

   Each cell `(i, j)` in the grid is updated according to its current state:

   2.1 Active Cells (`grid[i, j] > 0`)
        - Increment Lifetime: The lifetime of the cell is incremented by 1 (`lifetime_grid[i, j] += 1`).
        - Neighbor Counting: The number of active neighbors is determined by checking cells in the directions specified 
          by `propagation_directions`.
        - Death Probability:
            - The death probability `P_death` for the cell is computed as:
              `P_death = min(base_death_probability * (1 + lifetime_grid[i, j] / 10), max_death_probability)`
            - If the cell has no active neighbors, the death probability is set to `isolated_death_probability`.
            - The cell remains active if a random number exceeds `P_death`; otherwise, it becomes inactive.
        - Activity Decrement: If the cell remains active, its activity level decreases by 1 (`grid[i, j] -= 1`).
        - Refractory Period Update: The cells refractory period is recalculated with a random multiplier, and
          `refractory_grid[i, j]` is updated.

   2.2 Inactive and Non-Refractory Cells (`grid[i, j] == 0` and `refractory_grid[i, j] == 0`)
        - Neighbor Counting and Wave ID Collection:
            - Active neighbors are counted, and their wave IDs are collected.
        - Activation Probability:
            - The probability `P_activate` of the cell becoming active is calculated as:
              `P_activate = min(active_neighbors * propagation_probability * excitability[i, j], 0.8)`
            - The cell activates if a random number is less than `P_activate`.
        - Wave ID Assignment:
            - If the cell activates and has neighbors with wave IDs, it inherits the most common wave ID among its 
              neighbors.
            - If the cell activates but has no active neighbors, it is assigned a new wave ID (`next_wave_id`).
        - Spontaneous Activation:
            - If the cell does not activate through its neighbors, it may activate spontaneously with a probability:
              `P_spontaneous = wave_formation_probability * excitability[i, j]`
            - The process for wave ID assignment follows the same logic as for neighbor-induced activation.

   2.3 Refractory Cells (`refractory_grid[i, j] > 0`)
        - Refractory cells do not activate and remain inactive until their refractory period expires.

3. Propagation Directions
    - The directions in which neighbors are checked (`propagation_directions`) influence the potential paths of wave 
      propagation. Typical directions might include the cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) or may also include 
      diagonals.

4. Wave ID Management
    - Wave ID Inheritance: When a cell becomes active due to its neighbors, it inherits the most common wave ID among 
      those neighbors.
    - New Wave ID: If a cell activates without neighbors or all neighbor wave IDs are inactive, it is assigned a new 
      wave ID, and `next_wave_id` is incremented.

5. Simulation Process
    - The simulation runs for a specified number of steps. At each step, the grid is updated according to the rules 
      above.
    - The state of the grid (`history`) and the wave ID grid (`wave_id_history`) are recorded for each time step, 
      allowing for analysis of wave propagation and tracking.
