[requires]
# Use a version specifier to indicate compatibility with 3.12 and newer.
# This tells pipenv to look for a Python interpreter that is 3.12 or greater.
python_version = ">=3.12"

# OPTIONAL: If you want to be more specific about a "full" version,
# you could use python_full_version, but python_version is usually sufficient.
# For example, if you specifically knew you wanted 3.12.5 or newer:
# python_full_version = ">=3.12.5"

# If you prefer to allow any 3.x version but ensure it's at least 3.12,
# you could also use a combination:
# python_version = "3"
# python_full_version = ">=3.12" # This might be redundant with the line above
