----------------------------------
Website and documentation launched
----------------------------------

We are happy to share this new website and documentation for copan:LPJmL.

This is the first step in a long journey to make copan:LPJmL more accessible to
the community.

Even though many features are still missing, we hope you find it useful.
Please let us know if you have any feedback in the
`discussions <https://github.com/pik-copan/pycopanlpjml/discussions/>`_ section
of the GitHub repository.
