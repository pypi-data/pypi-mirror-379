    """
    Compute the Internal Bar Strength (IBS) indicator.

    The IBS is defined as:
        IBS = (Close - Low) / (High - Low)

    It measures where the closing price is located within the day's range,
    and is commonly used to detect short-term overbought or oversold conditions.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing OHLC data.
        high_col (str): Name of the column representing the high price.
        low_col (str): Name of the column representing the low price.
        close_col (str): Name of the column representing the closing price.

    Returns:
        pd.Series: A Series with the IBS values, indexed like the input DataFrame.
