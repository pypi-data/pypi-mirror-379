    Compute a causal Savitzky-Golay filter using optimized matrix operations.

    This version reproduces the behavior of:
        df[col].rolling(window_size).apply(lambda x: savgol_filter(x, window_size, polyorder)[-1])

    It applies a rolling polynomial regression over a past-only window, avoiding look-ahead bias.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the input series.
        col (str): Column name of the series to smooth.
        window_size (int): Length of the rolling window (must be odd).
        polyorder (int): Degree of the fitted polynomial (must be < window_size).

    Returns:
        pd.Series: Smoothed series using the causal Savitzky-Golay filter.
