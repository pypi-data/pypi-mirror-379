"""
Framed I/O utilities for the Nemoria protocol.

Messages are sent and received as **length-prefixed** binary frames:
- A 4-byte **big-endian** unsigned integer header specifies payload length.
- The payload is optionally **encrypted** (using `pwd`) and must decode to a
  Python `dict` that `Frame.deserialize()` can consume.

These helpers do not catch network/crypto errors beyond basic validation; such
errors are allowed to propagate so callers can decide how to handle them.

async def recv(reader: asyncio.StreamReader, pwd: Optional[str] = None) -> Frame:
    """
    Read one length-prefixed frame and return a `Frame` instance.

    This function:
      1) reads a 4-byte big-endian length header,
      2) reads exactly `length` bytes of payload,
      3) decrypts (if `pwd` is provided) and deserializes the payload into a `Frame`.

    Args:
        reader: The stream to read from (bound to a TCP socket).
        pwd: Optional shared secret used by `decrypt()`.

    Returns:
        A `Frame` reconstructed via `Frame.deserialize(...)`.

    Raises:
        asyncio.IncompleteReadError: If the stream closes before enough bytes arrive.
        ValueError: If the length is non-positive or the decrypted payload is not a dict.
        Exception: Any error raised by `decrypt()` or `Frame.deserialize()` is propagated.

    Notes:
        - This call is **framing-aware** and blocks until a full frame is available.
        - It does not perform retries; callers should handle reconnection/backoff.
