# Tags plot

A convenience script using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to plot [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/) mesh tags.

This script was inspired by this [tutorial](https://github.com/multiphenics/multiphenicsx/blob/main/tutorials/07_understanding_restrictions/tutorial_understanding_restrictions.ipynb) from [multiphenicsx](https://multiphenics.github.io/).
