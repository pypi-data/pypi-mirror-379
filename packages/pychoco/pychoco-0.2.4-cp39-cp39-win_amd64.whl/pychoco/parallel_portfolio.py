class ParallelPortfolio(_HandleWrapper):
    """
    A Portfolio helper.
    The ParallelPortfolio resolution of a problem is made of four steps:

        1. adding models to be run in parallel,
        2. running resolution in parallel,
        3. getting the model which finds a solution (or the best one), if any.

    Each of the four steps is needed and the order is imposed too. In particular, in step 1. each model should be
    populated individually with a model of the problem (presumably the same model, but not required). Populating model
    is not managed by this class and should be done before applying step 2 with a dedicated method for instance. Note
    also that there should not be pending resolution process in any models. Otherwise, unexpected behaviors may occur.

    The resolution process is synchronized. As soon as one model ends (naturally or by hitting a limit) the other ones
    are eagerly stopped. Moreover, when dealing with an optimization problem, cut on the objective variable's value is
    propagated to all models on solution.

    It is essential to eagerly declare the objective variable(s) with {@link Model#setObjective(boolean, Variable)}.
    Note that the similarity of the models declared is not required. However, when dealing with an optimization
    problem, keep in mind that the cut on the objective variable's value is propagated among all models, so different
    objectives may lead to wrong results.

    Since there is no condition on the similarity of the models, once the resolution ends, the model which finds the
    (best) solution is internally stored.

        themselves but also based on other workers of the portfolio.

        each worker).

        Important: the populating process is not managed by this parallel portfolio and should be done externally,
        with a dedicated method for example.

        When dealing with optimization problems, the objective variables <b>HAVE</b> to be declared eagerly with
        model.set_objective(variable, boolean).

        A reliable model is expected to prove the absence of a solution, improving one in the case of optimisation
        problem. A model with non-redundant constraints posted to improve resolution at the expense of completeness
        is considered unreliable. An unreliable model cannot share its no-goods and when it stops, cannot stop other
        models. There should be at least one reliable model in a portfolio. Otherwise, solving may be made incomplete.
