    A Directed Graph Variable is defined by a domain which is a graph interval [LB, UB].
    An instantiation of a directed graph variable is a directed graph composed of nodes and edges.
    LB is the kernel graph (or lower bound), that must be a subgraph of any instantiation.
    UB is the envelope graph (or upper bound), such that any instantiation is a subgraph of it.
