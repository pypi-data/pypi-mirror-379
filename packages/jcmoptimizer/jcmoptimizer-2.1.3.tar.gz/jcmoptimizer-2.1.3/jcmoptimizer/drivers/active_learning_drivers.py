              is used.
          append: If true, the samples are appended to the samples of
              the previous MCMC run.
          max_sigma_dist: If set, the sampling is restricted to a
              a distance max_sigma_dist * sigma to the maximum likelihood
              estimate. E.g. ``max_sigma_dist=3.0`` means that only the 99.7%

        r"""Runs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of posterior probability
        of the parameters. By default the prior probability density of the parameters
        is a uniform distribution in the whole parameter domain. Other parameter
        distributions can be defined via ``study.configure(parameter_distribution =

                distributions=[

        The estimated error of a Monte-Carlo integration of some function :math:`f` is
        :math:`\delta = \sigma / \sqrt{N_{\rm ind}}` where :math:`\sigma^2` is the
        variance of :math:`f` and :math:`N_{\rm ind}` is the number of *independent*
        samples from the probability distribution.  The error relative to the
        variance :math:`\sigma^2` is therefore :math:`\delta_{\rm rel}=1/\sqrt{N_{\rm
        ind}}`. Assuming, that subsequent samples of a chain are correlated and this
        correlation vanishes at a correlation time :math:`\tau`, :math:`N_{\rm ind} =
        N/\tau` of all :math:`N` MCMC samples are independent.  Note, that
        :math:`\tau` can only be estimated and thus the relative Monte-Carlo
        integration error :math:`\delta_{\rm rel}=\tau/\sqrt{N}` can be under or
        overestimated.
        
        Args:
          num_walkers: Number of walkers. If not specified, the value is
              automatically chosen.
          max_iter: Maximum absolute chain length. 
          max_time: Maximum run time in seconds. If not specified, the runtime
              is not limited.
          rel_error: Targeted relative Monte-Carlo integration error
              :math:`\delta_{\rm rel}` of the samples.
          thin_chains: If true, only every :math:`\tau`-th sample of all
              MCMC samples is returned. This is helpful if the full number of samples
              gets too large and a representative uncorrelated subset is required.
          multi_modal: If true, a more explorative sampling strategy
              is used.
          append: If true, the samples are appended to the samples of
              the previous MCMC run.
          float max_sigma_dist: If set, the sampling is restricted to a
               a distance max_sigma_dist * sigma to the maximum likelihood
               estimate. E.g. max_sigma_dist=3.0 means that only the 99.7% 
               probability region of each parameter is sampled. (default: inf)
          min_dist: In order to speed up the prediction, one can use a
              sparsified version of the base surrogates where sampling
              with a distance smaller than min_dist (in terms of the length
              scales of the surrogate) are neglected.

        Returns: A dictionary with the following entries:

            :samples: The drawn samples without "burn-in" samples thinned by
                     half of the correlation time.
            :medians: The medians of all random parameters
            :lower_uncertainties: The distances between the medians and the
                     16% quantile of all random parameters
            :upper_uncertainties: The distance between the medians and the
                     84% quantile of all random parameters
            :tau: Estimated correlation time of each parameter.
