This package implements a python client for interacting with the JCMoptimizer server. It provides a convenient interface to set up, run, and analyze numerical studies of expensive black box functions.

## Getting Started ##

You need install JCMsuite and the JCMoptimizer extension for JCMsuite:
* Browse to the [JCMsuite download](https://installation.jcmwave.com/fb13885794fc64c42531c9656f8f6f73.php) page to install JCMsuite and to retrieve a demo or commercial license.
* Browse to the [JCMoptimizer download](https://optimizer.jcmwave.com/download-jcmoptimizer) page to install JCMoptimzizer.
* Install the `jcmoptimizer` package into your python environmentm, e.g. by runing `pip install jcmoptimizer`.

A basic usage example of the python package is given in the tutorial on a [Bayesian Optimization](https://optimizer.jcmwave.com/documentation/python/latest/tutorials/vanilla_bayesian_optimization.html).
