# HDF5_BLS

**HDF5_BLS** is a Python library for handling Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) data and converting it into a standardized HDF5 format. The library provides functions to open raw data files, define and import abscissa, add metadata, and save the organized data in HDF5 files.
The library is currently compatible with the following file formats:
- "*.dat" files: dat spectra obtained with:
    - [GHOST](https://tablestable.com/en/downloads/) software 
    - Time Domain measures (format defined by Sal La Cavera)
- "*.npy" files: a numpy file
- "*.sif" files: image files obtained with [Andor](https://andor.oxinst.com) cameras
- All image files supported by the Pillow library (see [this link](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html#write-only-formats))

## GUI

The GUI is now capable of:
- Create new HDF5 files following the structure of v1.0.0:
    - Structure the file in a hierarchical way
    - Import measure data (drag and drop functionality implemented)
    - Import measure data from a CSV file (drag and drop functionality implemented)
    - Modify parameters of data both by group and individually from the GUI
- Export sub-HDF5 files from meta files
- Export Python code to access individual datasets
- Analyze raw spectra obtained with a VIPA spectrometer

## Library 

### Library installation

You can install **HDF5_BLS** directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install HDF5_BLS
```
Please refer to [the tutorial](https://github.com/bio-brillouin/HDF5_BLS/blob/v-1.0.0/guides/Tutorial/Tutorial.pdf) for more information.
