# deph: Isolate, Analyze, and Compose Your Python Code

`deph` is a developer utility designed to untangle Python codebases. It traces and isolates all the necessary source code for a specific function or class (an "endpoint"), analyzes its dependencies, and then composes the code into a clean, self-contained module.

This is especially powerful for code developed in interactive environments like **Jupyter Notebooks**, where dependencies can be scattered and implicit. `deph` helps you extract a piece of logic—like a model's prediction function or a data processing pipeline—from a complex notebook or script and prepare it for refactoring, testing, or future packaging.

## Key Features

-   **Endpoint-based Code Isolation**: Pinpoint a function or class, and `deph` will recursively find all internal dependencies (other functions, classes, global variables) required for it to run.
-   **Dependency Analysis**: Automatically identifies the standard library, third-party, and local modules your isolated code depends on.
-   **Source Code Composition**: Gathers all the required source code and assembles it into a single, clean Python module, ready for use in a new context.
-   **Jupyter-Aware**: Intelligently parses the structure of Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files), treating them as valid source entry points.

## Why Use `deph`? (The Problem)

Imagine you have a large Jupyter Notebook used for exploratory data analysis. It contains a critical function for training a model, but its helper functions and imports are spread across dozens of cells. To move that training logic into a production pipeline, you would have to:

1.  Manually copy-paste the main function.
2.  Hunt down every helper function it calls.
3.  Figure out which `import` statements are actually needed.
4.  Repeat this process until the code runs without errors.

`deph` automates this. It answers the question: **"What is the absolute minimum code and which libraries are required to run this specific function?"**

**Use Cases:**

-   Isolating logic from a monolithic script to create a reusable module.
-   Extracting a specific feature from a Jupyter Notebook to create a standalone script.
-   Preparing a piece of logic to be packaged into a library or deployed as a service.
-   Understanding the true dependencies of a specific part of your application.

## Installation
```bash
python -m pip install deph
```

## Quickstart

Let's say you have a Python file `my_model.py` containing a function `train_model` that you want to isolate.

```python
# my_model.py
import pandas as pd

def preprocess(data):
    return data.dropna()

def train_model(df: pd.DataFrame):
    processed_df = preprocess(df)
    # ... training logic ...
    return "Model trained!"
```

You can use `deph`'s high-level functions to isolate `train_model` and all its local dependencies (like `preprocess`):

```python
from deph import isolate
from my_model import train_model

# 1. Isolate the target function to get the composed code and a report.
code, report = isolate([train_model])

# 2. Print the results.
print("--- ISOLATED SOURCE CODE ---")
print(code)

print("\n--- IDENTIFIED DEPENDENCIES ---")
print(report.get("imports"))
```

This will produce a self-contained script with `train_model`, `preprocess`, and the necessary `import pandas as pd` statement, along with a detailed dependency report.
