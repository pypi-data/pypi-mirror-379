## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Go to https://github.com/AakarSharma/fast-django and click "Fork"
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fast-django.git
   cd fast-django
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/AakarSharma/fast-django.git
   ```

4. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install the package in development mode with all dependencies
   pip install -e ".[dev,test,docs]"

   # Install pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

## üß™ Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src/fast_django --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run linting
ruff check .

# Auto-fix linting issues
ruff check . --fix

# Check code formatting
ruff format --check .

# Auto-format code
ruff format .

# Run type checking
mypy src

# Run all checks at once
ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy src && pytest
```

### Building Documentation

```bash
# Serve documentation locally
mkdocs serve

# Build documentation
mkdocs build

# Check for broken links
mkdocs build --strict
```

## üìù Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Ruff** - Fast Python linter and formatter
- **MyPy** - Static type checking
- **Pre-commit** - Git hooks for code quality
- **Pytest** - Testing framework

### Code Style Guidelines

1. **Follow PEP 8** - Use ruff to automatically format code
2. **Type Hints** - Add type hints to all functions and methods
3. **Docstrings** - Use Google-style docstrings for public APIs
4. **Tests** - Write tests for new features and bug fixes
5. **Documentation** - Update documentation for user-facing changes

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically run checks before each commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Skip hooks for a commit (not recommended)
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```
