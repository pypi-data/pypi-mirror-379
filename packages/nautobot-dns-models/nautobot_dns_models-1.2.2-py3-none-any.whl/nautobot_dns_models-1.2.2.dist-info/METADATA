## Overview

The DNS models app adds specific DNS related models for managing DNS zones and records to Nautobot. The goal is to be able to manage a DNS configuration for a zone or sub-zone. These models can then be leveraged with 3rd party IPAM or DNS services in line with the rest of your network data.

### Screenshots

More screenshots can be found in the [Using the App](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/dns-models/en/latest/user/app_use_cases/) page in the documentation. Here's a quick overview of some of the app's added functionality:
