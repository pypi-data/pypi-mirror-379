Contributing
============

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AutoClean EEG as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

Development Process
-------------------

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from ``main``.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

Development Setup
-----------------

1. Clone your fork and install development dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/cincibrainlab/autoclean_pipeline.git
      cd autoclean-eeg
      pip install -e ".[dev]"

2. Set up pre-commit hooks:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pre-commit install

Code Style
----------

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

* `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/>`_ for code formatting
* `isort <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/>`_ for import sorting
* `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org/>`_ for static type checking
* `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/>`_ for style guide enforcement

Run the following before committing:

.. code-block:: bash

   black .
   isort .
   mypy src/autoclean
   flake8 src/autoclean

Testing
-------

We use pytest for testing. Run the test suite:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest

For coverage report:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest --cov=autoclean

Documentation
-------------

We use Sphinx for documentation. Build the docs:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd docs
   make html

Pull Request Process
--------------------

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the docs/ with any new documentation
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with a note describing your changes
4. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

Licensing
---------

Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License.

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

Bug Reports
-----------

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by `opening a new issue <https://github.com/cincibrainlab/autoclean_pipeline/issues/new>`_.

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
   * Be specific!
   * Give sample code if you can.
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
