Core Concepts
-------------

AutoClean is built around simple, intuitive concepts:

**Workspace**
   Your personal folder (in Documents/Autoclean-EEG) containing all your custom tasks, configuration, and processing results.

**Tasks** 
   Pre-configured processing workflows for specific experiments (e.g., resting-state, auditory experiments). Each task contains all the settings and steps needed to process your data.

**Pipeline**
   The processing engine that takes your data and task, then automatically handles all the complex EEG preprocessing steps.

**Auto-Discovery**
   Simply drop task files into your workspace - AutoClean automatically finds and makes them available for use.

Quick Start Examples
-------------------

**ðŸŽ¯ For Non-Technical Users (Command Line)**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install AutoClean
   pip install autocleaneeg-pipeline
   
   # Run first-time setup
   autoclean setup
   
   # Process your data (that's it!)
   autoclean process RestingEyesOpen my_eeg_data.raw
   
   # Export audit trail for compliance
   autoclean export-access-log --output audit.jsonl

**ðŸ”§ For Technical Users (Python)**

.. code-block:: python

   from autoclean import Pipeline

   # Simple usage - uses your workspace automatically  
   pipeline = Pipeline()
   pipeline.process_file("my_data.raw", "RestingEyesOpen")
   
   # Custom output location
   pipeline = Pipeline(output_dir="my_results/")
   pipeline.process_file("my_data.raw", "CustomTask")
