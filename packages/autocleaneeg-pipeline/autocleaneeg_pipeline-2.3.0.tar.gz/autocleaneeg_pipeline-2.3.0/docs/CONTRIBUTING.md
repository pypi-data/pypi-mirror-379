# Contributing to AutoClean EEG

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AutoClean EEG as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork and install development dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cincibrainlab/autoclean_pipeline.git
cd autoclean-eeg
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

2. Set up pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for style guide enforcement

Run the following before committing:
```bash
black .
isort .
mypy src/autoclean
flake8 src/autoclean
```

## Testing

We use pytest for testing. Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest
```

For coverage report:
```bash
pytest --cov=autoclean
```

## Documentation

We use Sphinx for documentation. Build the docs:
```bash
cd docs
make html
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the docs/ with any new documentation
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with a note describing your changes
4. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/cincibrainlab/autoclean_pipeline/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/cincibrainlab/autoclean_pipeline/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
