# Changelog
## [2.3.0] - 9/24/2025

### Changed
- BREAKING: Upgraded `mne-icalabel` to `>=0.8.0`, which introduces a hard dependency on `onnxruntime`. This may require users to install additional system packages or use compatible wheels, especially on Apple Silicon and Linux distributions.

### Notes
- If you experience installation issues, ensure `onnxruntime` (or `onnxruntime-silicon` on Apple Silicon, if preferred) is available. See project README for troubleshooting tips.


All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [2.1.1] - 6/23/2025

### 🐛 BUG FIXES
- **Plugin Registration**: Fixed multiple plugin registration causing verbose log output with duplicate "Overriding" warnings

### Changed
- **Log Verbosity**: Moved plugin/format registration messages from INFO to DEBUG level for cleaner output

   # NEW (v2.0.0)
   pipeline = Pipeline(output_dir="output")
   ```

2. **Task Configuration**:
   - YAML configuration files no longer required for built-in tasks
