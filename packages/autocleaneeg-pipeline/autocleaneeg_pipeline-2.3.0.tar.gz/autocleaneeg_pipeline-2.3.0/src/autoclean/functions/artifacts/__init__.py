"""Artifact Detection and Channel Operations Functions.

This module contains standalone functions for detecting and handling artifacts
in EEG data, including bad channel detection, interpolation, and channel operations.

Functions
---------
detect_bad_channels : Detect bad channels using multiple methods
interpolate_bad_channels : Interpolate bad channels using spherical splines
drop_channels : Remove specified channels from data
