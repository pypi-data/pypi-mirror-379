              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Install single operator
rhoshift --serverless

# Install multiple operators
rhoshift --serverless --servicemesh

# Install cert-manager operator
rhoshift --cert-manager

# Install Kueue operator with default managementState (Unmanaged)
# Automatically installs cert-manager dependency
rhoshift --kueue

# Install Kueue operator with specific managementState in DSC
rhoshift --kueue Managed     # Sets Kueue as Managed in DSC
rhoshift --kueue Unmanaged   # Sets Kueue as Unmanaged in DSC

# Install KEDA (Custom Metrics Autoscaler) operator
rhoshift --keda

# Install RHOAI with raw configuration
rhoshift --rhoai --rhoai-channel=<channel> --rhoai-image=<image> --raw=True

# Install RHOAI with Serverless configuration
rhoshift --rhoai --rhoai-channel=<channel> --rhoai-image=<image> --raw=False --all

# Install all operators (Kueue will be set to Unmanaged in DSC)
rhoshift --all

# Create DSC and DSCI with RHOAI operator installation
rhoshift --rhoai --deploy-rhoai-resources

# Clean up all operators
rhoshift --cleanup
```

### 🔗 Operator Dependencies & Validation

The tool automatically handles operator dependencies and provides smart validation:

#### **Automatic Dependency Resolution**
- **Kueue** requires **cert-manager**: Installing Kueue automatically includes cert-manager
- Dependencies are installed in the correct order to prevent failures
- Missing dependencies are automatically detected and added

```bash
# This command will install BOTH cert-manager AND Kueue (in correct order)
# Kueue will be set to Unmanaged in DSC (if DSC exists)
rhoshift --kueue

# You'll see output like:
# 📦 Auto-adding dependency: cert-manager
# Installing 2 operators in order: cert-manager → kueue
# 🔄 Updating DSC with Kueue managementState: Unmanaged
# ✅ Successfully updated DSC with Kueue managementState: Unmanaged
```

#### **Smart Validation**
- **Compatibility Checking**: Warns about potential operator conflicts
- **Namespace Validation**: Detects if operators conflict in shared namespaces
- **Pre-Installation Validation**: Catches issues before installation starts

```bash
# Example validation warnings:
# ⚠️  Note: Kueue and KEDA may have resource conflicts. Monitor for admission webhook issues.
# ⚠️  Installation order will be adjusted for dependencies: cert-manager → kueue
```

#### **Supported Dependencies**
| Primary Operator | Required Dependencies |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Kueue           | cert-manager         |

> **Note**: When installing Kueue individually (`--kueue`), you will see dependency warnings. For automatic dependency installation, use batch mode (`--cert-manager --kueue`) or install dependencies manually first.

### 🎯 Kueue DSC Integration

**New Feature**: Kueue operator installation now automatically updates the RHOAI DataScienceCluster (DSC) when a management state is specified.

#### **Kueue Management States**
- **`Managed`**: RHOAI controls Kueue configuration and lifecycle
- **`Unmanaged`**: Kueue runs independently, not managed by RHOAI

#### **Usage Examples**

```bash
# Install Kueue as Managed (RHOAI controls it)
rhoshift --kueue Managed

# Install Kueue as Unmanaged (independent operation) - DEFAULT
rhoshift --kueue Unmanaged
rhoshift --kueue  # Same as above

# Switch between states (updates existing DSC)
rhoshift --kueue Managed    # Change to Managed
rhoshift --kueue Unmanaged  # Change back to Unmanaged
```

#### **Behavior**
- **DSC Exists**: Automatically updates Kueue managementState in existing DSC
- **No DSC**: Shows info message that state will be applied when DSC is created
- **Error Handling**: Graceful warnings if DSC update fails

#### **Output Examples**
```bash
# When DSC exists and gets updated:
🔄 Updating DSC with Kueue managementState: Unmanaged
✅ Successfully updated DSC with Kueue managementState: Unmanaged

# When no DSC exists:
ℹ️  No existing DSC found. Kueue managementState will be applied when DSC is created.
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Custom oc binary path
rhoshift --serverless --oc-binary /path/to/oc

# Custom timeout (seconds)
rhoshift --all --timeout 900

# Install queue management and auto-scaling operators together
# (cert-manager will be automatically installed as Kueue dependency)
rhoshift --kueue Managed --keda

# Install complete ML/AI stack with queue management
rhoshift --rhoai --kueue Managed --keda --rhoai-channel=stable --rhoai-image=quay.io/rhoai/rhoai-fbc-fragment:rhoai-2.25-nightly

# Show summary of all supported operators and their versions
rhoshift --summary

# Install only cert-manager for other uses
rhoshift --cert-manager

# Verbose output
rhoshift --all --verbose
```

### Upgrade Matrix Testing

To run the upgrade matrix tests, you can use either method:

1. Using the shell script:
```bash
./run_upgrade_matrix.sh [options] <current_version> <current_channel> <new_version> <new_channel>
```

2. Using the Python command:
```bash
run-upgrade-matrix [options] <current_version> <current_channel> <new_version> <new_channel>
```

Options:
- `-s, --scenario`: Run specific scenario(s) (serverless, rawdeployment, serverless,rawdeployment)
- `--skip-cleanup`: Skip cleanup before each scenario
- `--from-image`: Custom source image path
- `--to-image`: Custom target image path

Example:
```bash
# Using shell script
./run_upgrade_matrix.sh -s serverless -s rawdeployment 2.10 stable 2.12 stable

# Using Python command
run-upgrade-matrix -s serverless -s rawdeployment 2.10 stable 2.12 stable
```

## 📝 Logging

The toolkit uses a comprehensive logging system:
- Logs are stored in `/tmp/rhoshift.log`
- Console output shows INFO level and above
- File logging captures DEBUG level and above
- Automatic log rotation (10MB max size, 5 backup files)
- Colored output in supported terminals

To view logs:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/rhoshift.log
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `LOG_FILE_LEVEL`: Set file logging level (default: DEBUG)
- `LOG_CONSOLE_LEVEL`: Set console logging level (default: INFO)

### Command Options

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Operator Installation Fails**
   - Check cluster access: `oc whoami`
   - Verify operator catalog: `oc get catalogsource`
   - Check logs: `tail -f /tmp/rhoshift.log`

2. **Permission Issues**
   - Ensure you have cluster-admin privileges
   - Check namespace permissions

3. **Timeout Errors**
   - Increase timeout: `--timeout 900`
   - Check cluster resources
