              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwaykole/O.git
cd O
pip install -e .
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
rhoshift --help
rhoshift --summary
```

## 💻 Usage

### **Basic Commands**
```bash
# Install single operator with enhanced stability
rhoshift --serverless

# Install multiple operators with batch optimization
rhoshift --serverless --servicemesh --authorino

# Install with dependency resolution (Kueue + cert-manager)
rhoshift --kueue

# Install all operators (includes DSCI validation for RHOAI)
rhoshift --all

# Install all with RHOAI channel preference
rhoshift --all --rhoai-channel=odh-nightlies

# Show detailed operator summary
rhoshift --summary

# Clean up all operators
rhoshift --cleanup
```

### **RHOAI with DSC/DSCI**
```bash
# Install RHOAI with complete setup
rhoshift --rhoai \
  --rhoai-channel=odh-nightlies \
  --rhoai-image=brew.registry.redhat.io/rh-osbs/iib:1049242 \
  --deploy-rhoai-resources

# Install RHOAI with Kueue integration
rhoshift --rhoai --kueue Managed \
  --rhoai-channel=stable \
  --rhoai-image=quay.io/rhoai/rhoai-fbc-fragment:rhoai-2.25-nightly \
  --deploy-rhoai-resources
```

### **Kueue Management States**
```bash
# Install Kueue as Managed (RHOAI controls it)
rhoshift --kueue Managed

# Install Kueue as Unmanaged (independent) - Default
rhoshift --kueue Unmanaged
rhoshift --kueue  # Same as above

# Switch management states (updates existing DSC)
rhoshift --kueue Managed    # Switch to Managed
rhoshift --kueue Unmanaged  # Switch to Unmanaged
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### **Enterprise Deployment**
```bash
# Complete ML/AI stack with queue management
rhoshift --all --kueue Managed \
  --rhoai-channel=stable \
  --rhoai-image=brew.registry.redhat.io/rh-osbs/iib:1049242 \
  --deploy-rhoai-resources \
  --timeout=900

# High-availability setup with service mesh
rhoshift --serverless --servicemesh --keda --authorino

# Development environment setup
rhoshift --cert-manager --kueue Unmanaged --keda
```

### **Custom Configuration**
```bash
# Custom timeouts and retries for enterprise clusters
rhoshift --all \
  --timeout=1200 \
  --retries=5 \
  --retry-delay=15

# Custom oc binary path
rhoshift --serverless --oc-binary=/usr/local/bin/oc

# Verbose output for debugging
rhoshift --kueue Managed --verbose
```

## 🔗 Dependency Management

RHOShift automatically handles operator dependencies:

### **Automatic Resolution**
- **Kueue** → **cert-manager**: Installing Kueue automatically includes cert-manager
- **Installation Order**: Dependencies installed first, primary operators second
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents namespace and resource conflicts

### **Smart Validation**
```bash
# This command installs BOTH cert-manager AND Kueue in correct order:
rhoshift --kueue
# Output:
# 🔍 Pre-flight checks passed. Cluster is ready for installation.
# ⚠️  Missing dependency: kueue-operator requires openshift-cert-manager-operator
# 🚀 Installing 2 operators with enhanced stability...
# ✅ cert-manager installed successfully
# ✅ kueue installed successfully
```

## 🤖 RHOAI Integration

### **DataScienceCluster Management**
RHOShift provides complete DSC/DSCI lifecycle management:

```bash
# Create RHOAI with DSC/DSCI
rhoshift --rhoai --deploy-rhoai-resources

# RHOAI with Kueue integration
rhoshift --rhoai --kueue Managed --deploy-rhoai-resources
```

### **DSC Behavior**
- **Existing DSC**: Automatically updates Kueue managementState
- **No DSC**: State applied when DSC is created via `--deploy-rhoai-resources`
- **Webhook Resilience**: Automatic handling of certificate timing issues

### **Output Examples**
```bash
# When DSC exists and gets updated:
🔄 Updating DSC with Kueue managementState: Managed
✅ Successfully updated DSC with Kueue managementState: Managed

# When no DSC exists:
ℹ️  No existing DSC found. Kueue managementState will be applied when DSC is created.
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Permission Errors**
```bash
# Verify cluster access
oc whoami
oc auth can-i create subscriptions -n openshift-operators
```

#### **Installation Failures**
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f /tmp/rhoshift.log

# Verify operator catalogs
oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace

# Check with enhanced timeouts
rhoshift --kueue --timeout=900 --retries=5
```

#### **Dependency Issues**
```bash
# Verify dependencies are resolved
rhoshift --summary

# Manual dependency installation
rhoshift --cert-manager
rhoshift --kueue
```

#### **RHOAI/DSC Issues**
```bash
# Check DSC status
oc get dsc,dsci -A

# Verify webhook certificates
oc get pods -n opendatahub-operators

# Manual DSC creation
rhoshift --rhoai --deploy-rhoai-resources --timeout=900
```

#### **DSCI Immutable Field Conflicts**
```bash
# Error: MonitoringNamespace is immutable
# This happens when existing DSCI has different monitoring namespace

# Check existing DSCI configuration
oc get dsci default-dsci -o yaml

# Solution 1: Force recreate DSCI (recommended)
rhoshift --rhoai --deploy-rhoai-resources

# Solution 2: Use existing DSCI configuration
# RHOShift will automatically detect and adapt to existing DSCI
```

### **Debug Mode**
```bash
# Enable verbose output
rhoshift --all --verbose

# Check stability report
rhoshift --summary
```
