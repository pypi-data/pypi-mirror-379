# region Main Function


# This is going to be a very slow function since it needs to do repeated flux sampling,
# to make it faster, it would be ideal to not have to repeatedly get warm up points
# But that would likely require modifying the cobra optgp sampling code
# ...which is probably not actually possible since a single gene change might influence many other limits
# there might be ways to adjust the sampling distribution but I'm not really sure...

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        Base cobra model to test effects of gene knockouts on
    genes_to_ko : Iterable[str]
        List of genes to investigate impact of their knock-out
    target_networks : list[str] | dict[str, list[str]]
        Target networks to investigate the impact of the gene knock-outs
        on. Can be a list or a dict of lists. If a dict, the keys will
        be used to name the network and the lists will specify the
        networks. If a list should be a single network. Entries in the
        lists can be either reaction or gene ids. Gene ids will be
        translated into reaction ids using the model. If a list is
        passed the name of the target network in the returned dataframe
        will be target_network, if a dict is passed the keys are used as
        the column names.
    divergence_metric : str
        Which metric to use for divergence, can be Jensen-Shannon, or
        Kullback-Leibler
    n_neighbors : int
        Number of neighbors to use when estimating divergence
    sample_count : int
        Number of samples to take when performing flux sampling (will be
        repeated for each gene knocked out)
    jitter : Union[None, float, tuple[float,float]]
        Amount of noise to add to avoid ties. If None no noise is added.
        If a float, that is the standard deviation of the random noise
        added to the continuous samples. If a tuple, the first element
        is the standard deviation of the noise added to the x array, the
        second element is the standard deviation added to the y array.
    jitter_seed : Union[None, int]
        Seed for the random number generator used for adding noise
    distance_metric : Union[str, float]
        Metric to use for computing distance between points in p and q,
        can be \"Euclidean\", \"Manhattan\", or \"Chebyshev\". Can also
        be a float representing the Minkowski p-norm.
    progress_bar : bool
        Whether a progress bar is desired
    **kwargs
        Arguments passed to the sample method of COBRApy, see `COBRApy
        Documentation <https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/
        cobra/sampling/index.html#cobra.sampling.sample>`_

    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        Dataframe with index of genes, and columns representing the
        different target networks. Values represent the divergence of a
        particular target network between the unperturbed model and the
        model following the gene knock-out.
