        fraction of optimum constraint applied before minimizing the sum
        of fluxes during pFBA.

            Each reaction is associated with a flux for generating a particular

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame[bool|float]
        A dataframe with genes as the index and metabolites as the
        columns, containing either

        1. Flux values if pfba is used. For a given gene and metabolite,
           this represents the maximum of reaction fluxes associated with a gene,
           found during pFBA required to maximally produce the metabolite.
        2. Boolean values if essentiality is used. For a given reaction and metabolite,
           this represents whether the reaction is essential for producing the
           metabolite.

    Notes
    -----
    For converting from the reaction fluxes to gene fluxes, the gene is assigned
    a value corresponding to the maximum magnitude flux the gene is associated
    with (but the value assigned keeps the sign). For example, if a gene was
    associated with reactions which had parsimonious flux values of -10, and 1 the
    gene would be assigned a value of -10.
