    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        A cobra.Model object to use for iMAT
    rxn_weights : dict | pandas.Series
        A dictionary or pandas series of reaction weights.
    imat_solution : cobra.Solution
        A pre-existing IMAT solution passed to the model creation
        methods, will only impact simple and subset as FVA and MILP
        solve altered versions of the IMAT problem.
    method : str
        The method to use for generating the context specific model.
        Valid methods are: 'imat_restrictions', 'simple_bounds',
        'subset', 'fva', 'milp'.
    epsilon : float
        The epsilon value to use for iMAT (default: 1). Represents the
        minimum flux for a reaction to  be considered on.

        The threshold value to use for iMAT (default: 1e-1). Represents
        the maximum flux for a reaction to be considered off.
    objective_tolerance : float
        The tolerance for the objective value (used for
