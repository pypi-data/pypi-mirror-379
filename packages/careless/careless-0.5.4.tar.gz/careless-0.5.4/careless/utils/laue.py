    Expand reflection observations to include all contributing harmonics. All 
    contributing reflections will be included out to a resolution cutoff 
    irrespective of peak wavelength.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ds : rs.DataSet
        Laue data without multiples. These should be unmerged data with 
        miller indices that have not been mapped to the ASU (P1 Miller Indices).
    dmin : float
        Highest resolution in Ã… to which harmonics will be predicted. If not 
        supplied, the highest resolution reflection in ds will set dmin.

    Returns
    -------
    ds : rs.DataSet
        DataSet with all reflection observations expanded to include their 
        constituent reflections. New columns 'H_0', 'K_0', 'L_0' will be added 
        to each reflection to store the Miller indices of the innermost 
        reflection on each central ray.
