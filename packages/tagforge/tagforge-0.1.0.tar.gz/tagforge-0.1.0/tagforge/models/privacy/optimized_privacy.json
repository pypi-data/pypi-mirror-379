        "related_llm_response": "Obtaining and processing human abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) tissue samples for RNA sequencing involves several critical steps, from collection to analysis. Below is a typical procedure outlining these steps:\n\n### 1. Ethical Approval and Patient Consent\n- **Obtain Ethical Approval**: Ensure that the study has received approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee.\n- **Informed Consent**: Obtain informed consent from patients undergoing surgical repair of AAA. Explain the purpose of the study and how their tissue will be used.\n\n### 2. Tissue Collection\n- **Surgical Procedure**: During the surgical repair of the AAA, the surgeon will excise the aneurysmal tissue.\n- **Immediate Collection**: Collect the AAA tissue immediately after excision. Use sterile instruments to minimize contamination.\n- **Sample Identification**: Label the samples with unique identifiers, including patient ID, date, and type of tissue.\n\n### 3. Sample Storage\n- **Preservation**: \n  - For RNA analysis, it is crucial to preserve the integrity of RNA. Place the tissue samples in RNA stabilization solution (e.g., RNAlater) immediately after collection.\n  - Alternatively, snap-freeze the tissue in liquid nitrogen if RNA stabilization solution is not available.\n- **Short-term Storage**: Store samples at 4°C for short-term (up to a week) or at -80°C for long-term storage.\n\n### 4. Tissue Processing\n- **Thawing**: If samples were frozen, thaw them on ice before processing.\n- **Dissection**: Using sterile tools, dissect the tissue to remove any non-aneurysmal areas or contaminants (e.g., fat, blood).\n- **Homogenization**: \n  - Cut the tissue into small pieces and homogenize using a tissue homogenizer or a mortar and pestle in a suitable lysis buffer (e.g., TRIzol or RNeasy lysis buffer) to extract RNA.\n  - Ensure that the homogenization is thorough to achieve a uniform sample.\n\n### 5. RNA Extraction\n- **RNA Isolation**: Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the chosen RNA extraction kit (e.g., RNeasy Mini Kit, TRIzol method).\n- **Quality Control**: Assess RNA quality and quantity using a spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop) and an RNA bioanalyzer (e.g., Agilent Bioanalyzer) to check for integrity (RIN value).\n\n### 6. Library Preparation for RNA Sequencing\n- **Library Construction**: Prepare RNA sequencing libraries using a library preparation kit (e.g., Illumina TruSeq, NEBNext). This typically involves:\n  - mRNA enrichment or rRNA depletion.\n  - cDNA synthesis.\n  - Fragmentation and adapter ligation.\n  - PCR amplification.\n- **Quality Control of Libraries**: Assess the quality and quantity of the libraries using a bioanalyzer or qPCR.\n\n### 7. Sequencing\n- **Sequencing Platform**: Load the prepared libraries onto a sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina NovaSeq, HiSeq) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n- **Run Sequencing**: Perform the sequencing run, ensuring to follow the appropriate settings for read length and depth based on the experimental design.\n\n### 8. Data Analysis\n- **Data Processing**: After sequencing, process the raw data using bioinformatics tools for quality control, alignment, and quantification of gene expression.\n- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform differential expression analysis and other relevant statistical analyses to interpret the results.\n\n### 9. Data Storage and Sharing\n- **Data Storage**: Store raw and processed data securely, following data management protocols.\n- **Sharing**: Consider sharing data in public repositories (e.g., GEO, ArrayExpress) to promote transparency and reproducibility.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis procedure outlines the essential steps for obtaining and processing AAA tissue samples for RNA sequencing. Each step must be performed with care to ensure the integrity of the samples and the reliability of the resulting data.",
