# For context, jax_verify is developed day-to-day using internal continuous
# integration software.
#
# The current Travis CI setup is unpolished and verifies that open-source
# jax_verify builds correctly. This is done on a best-effort basis; we are not
# attached to Travis CI.
#
# If you use jax_verify, continuous integration improvements are welcome.
