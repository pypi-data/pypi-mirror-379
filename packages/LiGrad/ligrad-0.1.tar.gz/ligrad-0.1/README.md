Transit Model for Gravity-Darkened Oblate Stars

This package can be used for generating transit light-curves for gravity-darkened, oblate stars using a simple vectorized approach.

It features:
- Gravity-darkening calculation
- Limb-darkening (Claret 4-parameter)
- Vectorized method for planet occultation integration
- Example scripts and a LaTeX manual included

See MANUAL.pdf for detailed instructions.
