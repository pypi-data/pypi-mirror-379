Tutorial Overview
-----------------

The tutorials are designed to take you from basic curve fitting to advanced optimization techniques:

1. **Quickstart**: Get up and running with NLSQ in 5 minutes
2. **Basic Fitting**: Learn fundamental curve fitting concepts
3. **Large Datasets**: Handle datasets with millions of points
4. **Advanced Features**: Explore robust loss functions and constraints
5. **Performance Optimization**: Maximize speed and memory efficiency

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the tutorials, ensure you have:

- Python 3.12+ installed
- NLSQ installed (see :doc:`installation`)
- Basic knowledge of Python and NumPy
- Familiarity with curve fitting concepts (helpful but not required)

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each tutorial includes:

- Clear objectives and learning outcomes
- Complete working code examples
- Explanations of key concepts
- Exercises to reinforce learning
- Links to relevant API documentation

The tutorials use Jupyter notebook format for interactive learning. You can:

1. Run them online using Google Colab (recommended for beginners)
2. Download and run locally with Jupyter
3. Copy code examples into your own scripts

Example Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All tutorials use realistic synthetic data that demonstrates common fitting scenarios:

- Linear and nonlinear relationships
- Noisy experimental data
- Multi-parameter functions
- Large scientific datasets
- Robust fitting with outliers
