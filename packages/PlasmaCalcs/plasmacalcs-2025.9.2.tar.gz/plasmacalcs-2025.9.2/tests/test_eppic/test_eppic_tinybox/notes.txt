deleted snap0 since it was 3MB (since it stored vdist?)

deleted compressed eppic.tgz code since it was 1.7MB.

For running new eppic simulations, download & compile code from https://gitlab.com/oppenheim/eppic

deleted eppic_0.i and eppic_0.slurm from "main folder" here, to avoid confusion.
(eppic.i is a copy of eppic_0.i. And, eppic_0.slurm can be found in the logs folder.)
