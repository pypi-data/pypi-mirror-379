Small region from the full Plage2D simulation:
snap='320'
slices=dict(z=slice(-300, -250, 1), x=slice(330, 380, 1))


Eos table was also interpolated from the full table (5000,5000) for each var (P, T, ne, kappaR):
```
os.chdir(Plage2D_directory)
arr = np.memmap(
         'eostable.dat',
          mode='r',
          offset=0, order='F',
          dtype=np.dtype(np.float32),
          shape=(5000,5000,4))  # 4 vars

new = np.memmap('eostable_small.dat',
          mode='w+',
          offset=0, order='F',
          dtype=np.dtype(np.float32),
          shape=(100,100,4))
new[:] = arr[::50, ::50]
new.flush()
```
TESTED - the new table values agree with the old table values, although the coords (in tabparam.in) are not aligned properly so there are some small issues.
(Specifically: RhoMin = 5e-17, RhoMax=1e-4 for the full 5000 points in r. When subsampling by 50x, the new RhoMax should actually be np.logspace(5e-17, 1e-4, 5000)[::50][-1], not 1e-4. Similar issue for EiMax. I didn't change the values in tabparam.in though.)
SUGGESTION: DON'T USE THIS TABLE TO DO SCIENCE. Get the full table elsewhere. The purpose of bifrost_tinybox isn't science, anyways. It's to test that PlasmaCalcs can read Bifrost data.
