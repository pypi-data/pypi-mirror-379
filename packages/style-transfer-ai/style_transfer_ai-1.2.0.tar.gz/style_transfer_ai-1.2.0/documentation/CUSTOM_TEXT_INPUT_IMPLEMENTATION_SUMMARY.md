### 1. Enhanced File Selection Menu
- **Added Option 3**: "Enter custom text directly (no files needed)"
- **Updated User Interface**: Clear options for file-based vs. text-based input
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing file-based workflows unchanged

### 2. Direct Text Input System
- **Interactive Text Entry**: Multi-line text input with double-Enter to finish
- **Smart Validation**: Word count checking and user confirmation for short texts
- **Flexible Input**: Supports single paragraphs to full documents
- **User Feedback**: Real-time character and word count display

### 3. Integrated Analysis Pipeline
- **Unified Processing**: Same analysis engine for both file and text input
- **Model Compatibility**: Works with all models (Ollama, OpenAI, Gemini)
- **Processing Modes**: Supports both 'enhanced' and 'statistical' analysis modes
- **Output Consistency**: Identical result format regardless of input method

### 4. Technical Implementation
- **Input Detection**: Automatic differentiation between file paths and custom text
- **Data Structure**: Special format for custom text with metadata
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of empty or invalid input
- **Source Tracking**: Clear identification of text source in results

3. **Select input method**: Option 3 "Enter custom text directly"
4. **Enter text**: Type or paste your content
5. **Finish input**: Press Enter twice to complete
6. **Get analysis**: Receive comprehensive stylometric results

### Input Example:
```
Enter your text (press Enter twice to finish):
--------------------------------------------------
This is my writing sample for stylometric analysis.
I want to understand my writing patterns, vocabulary
usage, and linguistic characteristics without having
to manage text files or complex setup procedures.

✓ Text captured: 32 words, 189 characters
```
