# Text Complexity Analyzer Test

This file demonstrates the new text complexity calculation feature added to the Style Transfer AI system.

## New Feature: `calculate_text_complexity_score()`

### Purpose
Provides a comprehensive complexity score for any given text based on multiple linguistic metrics.

### Metrics Included:
- **Sentence Complexity**: Average words per sentence
- **Vocabulary Complexity**: Word diversity and average word length
- **Readability Score**: Syllable-based readability assessment
- **Overall Score**: Weighted combination of all metrics

### Example Usage:
```python
from style_analyzer_enhanced import calculate_text_complexity_score

text = "Your sample text here."
complexity = calculate_text_complexity_score(text)
print(f"Overall complexity: {complexity['overall_score']}")
```

### Test Cases:
1. **Simple Text**: "I like cats. They are fun."
2. **Complex Text**: "The multifaceted implementation of sophisticated algorithms necessitates comprehensive understanding of underlying computational methodologies."

### Co-Authors:
This feature was developed collaboratively with multiple contributors demonstrating advanced stylometric analysis capabilities.
