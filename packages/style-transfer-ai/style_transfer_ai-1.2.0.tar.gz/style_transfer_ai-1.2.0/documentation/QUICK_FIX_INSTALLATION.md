# 🚨 QUICK FIX for Installation Errors

## For Your Friend Who Got the Pip Errors:

### **Simple Solution (Skip the complicated stuff):**

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're in the right directory
cd style-transfer-ai

# 2. Don't use pip install -e . (that's what's failing)
# Instead, just install the basic requirement:
pip install requests

# 3. Run the app directly:
python run.py
```

### **That's it!** 

If `python run.py` shows you a menu with options like:
```
STYLE TRANSFER AI - ADVANCED STYLOMETRY ANALYSIS
1. Analyze Writing Style
2. Quick Style Analysis  
...
```

**You're done!** ✅

# Then try again:
python run.py
```

### **Error: "pip not found"**

## **Need Help?**

If you're still stuck, send a screenshot of:
1. The error message
2. What directory you're in (`pwd` on Mac/Linux or `cd` on Windows)
3. Python version (`python --version`)

**The main thing: Use `python run.py` not `style-transfer-ai` command!**
