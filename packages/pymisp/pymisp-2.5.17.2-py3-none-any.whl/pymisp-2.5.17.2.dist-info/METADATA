**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This library will require **at least** Python 3.10 starting the 1st of January 2024. If you have legacy versions of python, please use the latest PyMISP version that will be released in December 2023, and consider updating your system(s). Anything released within the last 2 years will do, starting with Ubuntu 22.04.

# PyMISP - Python Library to access MISP

PyMISP is a Python library to access [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) platforms via their REST API.

PyMISP allows you to fetch events, add or update events/attributes, add or update samples or search for attributes.

## Install from pip

**It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment**

If you want to know more about virtual environments, [python has you covered](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

Only basic dependencies:
```
pip3 install pymisp
```

And there are a few optional dependencies:
* fileobjects: to create PE/ELF/Mach-o objects
* openioc: to import files in OpenIOC format (not really maintained)
* virustotal: to query VirusTotal and generate the appropriate objects
* docs: to generate te documentation
* pdfexport: to generate PDF reports out of MISP events
* url: to generate URL objects out of URLs with Pyfaup
* email: to generate MISP Email objects
* brotli: to use the brotli compression when interacting with a MISP instance

Example:

```
pip3 install pymisp[virustotal,email]
```

## Install the latest version from repo from development purposes

**Note**: poetry is required; e.g., "pip3 install poetry"

```
git clone https://github.com/MISP/PyMISP.git && cd PyMISP
git submodule update --init
poetry install -E fileobjects -E openioc -E virustotal -E docs -E pdfexport -E email
```

### Running the tests

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=pymisp tests/test_*.py
```

If you have a MISP instance to test against, you can also run the live ones:

**Note**: You need to update the key in `tests/testlive_comprehensive.py` to the automation key of your admin account.

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=pymisp tests/testlive_comprehensive.py
```

## Samples and how to use PyMISP

Various examples and samples scripts are in the [examples/](examples/) directory.

In the examples directory, you will need to change the keys.py.sample to enter your MISP url and API key.

```
cd examples
cp keys.py.sample keys.py
vim keys.py
```

The API key of MISP is available in the Automation section of the MISP web interface.

To test if your URL and API keys are correct, you can test with examples/last.py to
fetch the events published in the last x amount of time (supported time indicators: days (d), hours (h) and minutes (m)).
last.py
```
cd examples
python3 last.py -l 10h # 10 hours
python3 last.py -l 5d  #  5 days
python3 last.py -l 45m # 45 minutes
```


## Debugging

You have two options here:

1. Pass `debug=True` to `PyMISP` and it will enable logging.DEBUG to stderr on the whole module

2. Use the python logging module directly:

```python

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('pymisp')

# Configure it as you wish, for example, enable DEBUG mode:
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

Or if you want to write the debug output to a file instead of stderr:

```python
import pymisp
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger('pymisp')
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, filename="debug.log", filemode='w', format=pymisp.FORMAT)
```

## Test cases

1. The content of `mispevent.py` is tested on every commit
2. The test cases that require a running MISP instance can be run the following way:


```bash
# From poetry

pytest --cov=pymisp tests/test_*.py tests/testlive_comprehensive.py:TestComprehensive.[test_name]
```

## Documentation

The documentation is available [here](https://pymisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Jupyter notebook

A series of [Jupyter notebooks for PyMISP tutorial](https://github.com/MISP/PyMISP/tree/main/docs/tutorial) are available in the repository.

## Everything is a Mutable Mapping

... or at least everything that can be imported/exported from/to a json blob

`AbstractMISP` is the master class, and inherits from `collections.MutableMapping` which means
the class can be represented as a python dictionary.

The abstraction assumes every property that should not be seen in the dictionary is prepended with a `_`,
or its name is added to the private list `__not_jsonable` (accessible through `update_not_jsonable` and `set_not_jsonable`.

This master class has helpers that make it easy to load, and export to, and from, a json string.

`MISPEvent`, `MISPAttribute`, `MISPObjectReference`, `MISPObjectAttribute`, and `MISPObject`
are subclasses of AbstractMISP, which mean that they can be handled as python dictionaries.

## MISP Objects

Creating a new MISP object generator should be done using a pre-defined template and inherit `AbstractMISPObjectGenerator`.

Your new MISPObject generator must generate attributes and add them as class properties using `add_attribute`.

When the object is sent to MISP, all the class properties will be exported to the JSON export.

## Installing PyMISP on a machine with no internet access

This is done using poetry and you need to have this repository cloned on your machine.
The commands below have to be run from inside the cloned directory.


1. From a machine with access to the internet, get the dependencies:

```bash
mkdir offline
poetry export --all-extras  > offline/requirements.txt
poetry run pip download -r offline/requirements.txt -d offline/packages/
```

2. Prepare the PyMISP Package

```bash
poetry build
mv dist/*.whl offline/packages/
```

3. Copy the content of `offline/packages/` to the machine with no internet access.

4. Install the packages:

```bash
python -m pip install --no-index --no-deps packages/*.whl
```
