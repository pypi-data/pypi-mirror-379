### Configure the CLI 

##### Create your application
Follow the prompts from the tool in order to create your app.

```
scp-app create
```

Your app will be generated in your chosen directory.

##### Validate your application
You can check if your app structure is valid by using the validate command and the path of your app.

```
scp-app validate /tmp/test
```


### Run your application
You can check your app scripts are valid by using the run command.

```
# To run the install script
scp-app run install /tmp/test

# To run the uninstall script
scp-app run uninstall /tmp/test

# To run the migrate script
scp-app run migrate /tmp/test
```

##### Build your application
Once your application is validated and the scripts run without errors, you can create the build.

```
scp-app validate /tmp/test
```

It will build a '.sap' file in your app directory.
For example, for /tmp/test directory, it will be something like: /tmp/test/build/test-0.1.0.sap

### Publish your application
Once your application is built into a .sap file, you can publish the build on the SCP Appstore.

```
scp-app publish /tmp/test/build/test-0.1.0.sap
```
