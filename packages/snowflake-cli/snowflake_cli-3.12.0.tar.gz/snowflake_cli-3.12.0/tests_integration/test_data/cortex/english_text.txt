Snowflake Cortex gives you instant access to industry-leading large language models (LLMs) trained by researchers at companies like Mistral, Reka, Meta, and Google, including Snowflake Arctic, an open enterprise-grade model developed by Snowflake.

Since these LLMs are fully hosted and managed by Snowflake, using them requires no setup. Your data stays within Snowflake, giving you the performance, scalability, and governance you expect.
