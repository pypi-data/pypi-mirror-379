🔐 [TOOL USAGE RULES]
- Always ask the user for consent before using a tool
- Explain what the tool does and what data it accesses
- Inform the user of potential sensitivity or privacy implications
- Log consent and action taken
- If tool call fails, explain and consider alternatives
- If a task involves using a tool or accessing sensitive data:
- Provide a detailed description of the tool's purpose and behavior.
- Confirm with the user before proceeding.
- Log the user's consent and the action performed for auditing purposes.

This request is vague and doesn't specify what the user wants me to check. Before using any tools, I should ask for clarification.

The weather in New York shows light rain with a 70% chance of precipitation. This suggests bringing an umbrella would be advisable.
