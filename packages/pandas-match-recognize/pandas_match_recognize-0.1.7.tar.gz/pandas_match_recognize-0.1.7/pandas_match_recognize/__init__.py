SQL MATCH_RECOGNIZE for Pandas DataFrames

This package provides SQL:2016 MATCH_RECOGNIZE functionality for pandas DataFrames,
bringing powerful pattern matching capabilities to Python data science workflows.

ðŸš€ Features:
- Complete SQL:2016 MATCH_RECOGNIZE support
- High-performance finite automata engine  
- Advanced pattern constructs (quantifiers, alternation, PERMUTE)
- Comprehensive measure evaluation

Usage:
    from pandas_match_recognize import match_recognize
    
    result = match_recognize(sql_query, dataframe)

Features:
- Complete SQL:2016 MATCH_RECOGNIZE support  
- Finite automata-based pattern matching
- Advanced pattern constructs (quantifiers, alternation, PERMUTE)
- High-performance execution engine
- Comprehensive measure evaluation

Example:
    import pandas as pd
    from pandas_match_recognize import match_recognize
    
    # Sample data
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'customer_id': [1, 1, 1],
        'order_date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03'],
        'price': [100, 80, 60]
    })
    
    # Pattern matching query
    sql = '''
        SELECT * FROM df 
        MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
            PARTITION BY customer_id 
            ORDER BY order_date
            PATTERN (A B+ C)
            DEFINE 
                B AS B.price < A.price,
                C AS C.price < B.price
        )
    '''
    
    result = match_recognize(sql, df)
    print(result)
