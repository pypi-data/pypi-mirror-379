1. SQL Parser Module (Using a Parser Generator)

// Define full MATCH_RECOGNIZE grammar (using ANTLR, for example)
// Grammar covers:
//   - PARTITION BY clause (list of columns)
//   - ORDER BY clause (column names with ASC/DESC)
//   - MEASURES clause (list of measure expressions)
//   - PATTERN clause (row pattern with operators: concatenation, alternation, grouping, quantifiers, exclusions)
//   - SUBSET clause (mapping subset names to list of pattern variables)
//   - DEFINE clause (list of variable definitions with expressions)
//   - AFTER MATCH SKIP clause (options: PAST LAST ROW, TO FIRST <var>, TO LAST <var>)

SQL MATCH_RECOGNIZE
    PARTITION BY <column_list>
    ORDER BY <column_list>
    MEASURES <measure_list>
    PATTERN (<pattern>)
    DEFINE <variable_definitions>
    SUBSET <subset_mapping>
    AFTER MATCH SKIP <skip_option>

---    
AST Generation: Occurs immediately after parsing during the transformation phase.
Notes:
– The AST should capture every clause as a node.
– It must resolve subset expansions (e.g. if SUBSET U = (A, B), then any occurrence of U in PATTERN is replaced with (A | B)).

NFA/DFA generation for efficient pattern matching (execution phase).

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv


NFA/DFA Generation: Happens during the execution phase (in the engine module) when the canonical row pattern is compiled into a state machine for efficient matching.

function parseSQL(query: String) -> AST
    // Use a parser generator (e.g., ANTLR) to create a parse tree from query.
    ast = generateAST(query)
    validateAST(ast) // e.g., check that every pattern variable in PATTERN has a definition
    return ast

Walking the Parse Tree
If you want to extract information (e.g., table names, column names, patterns), you can use a Listener or Visitor:
Validating Queries

Now that the query is successfully parsed, you can build a SQL validation or transformation tool based on the tree.
custom query validation, rewriting, or analysis

NFA/DFA Generation

State Machine Construction:
The process of compiling the canonical row pattern (from the AST) into a nondeterministic or deterministic finite automaton for efficient execution is planned for the engine module and has not been implemented in the current phase.



2. Expression Evaluator Module
// The expression evaluator handles both boolean and arithmetic expressions.
// It supports navigation functions such as PREV(), NEXT(), FIRST(), LAST().
// It converts the expression into an Intermediate Representation (IR) for efficient repeated evaluation.

function compileExpression(expr: String) -> ExpressionIR
    // Parse the expression using a recursive descent parser or a tool like ANTLR.
    // Build an IR (e.g., an abstract syntax tree) that represents the expression.
    ir = parseAndBuildIR(expr)
    return ir

function evaluateExpression(ir: ExpressionIR, context: Map<String, Any>) -> Any
    // Recursively evaluate the IR using context (which might include:
    //   - The current row
    //   - The entire match (for FINAL semantics)
    //   - Pattern variable-specific row lists)
    // Example: If the IR represents PREV(A.price, 2), use context to look up the 2nd previous row for variable A.
    if ir is ConstantNode:
        return ir.value
    else if ir is VariableNode:
        return context[ir.name]
    else if ir is BinaryOpNode:
        left = evaluateExpression(ir.left, context)
        right = evaluateExpression(ir.right, context)
        return applyOperator(ir.operator, left, right)
    else if ir is FunctionCallNode:
        // For navigation functions:
        if ir.functionName equals "PREV":
            varName = ir.arguments[0]
            offset = (ir.arguments[1] if present else 1)
            return getPreviousRowValue(context, varName, offset)
        else if ir.functionName equals "NEXT":
            // Similarly for NEXT
        // Add support for FIRST, LAST, CLASSIFIER, MATCH_NUMBER as needed.
    else:
        throw ExpressionEvaluationError

Notes:
– The context is built from the current match state (e.g., a list of rows for each variable).
– The evaluator should distinguish running vs. final contexts.




3. Pattern Matching Engine (NFA/DFA)
// The engine receives the pattern AST from the SQL parser.
// It constructs an NFA that represents the row pattern.
// Optionally, it converts the NFA to a DFA for performance.

function buildNFA(patternAST: ASTNode) -> NFA
    // Recursively traverse the pattern AST:
    // - For a concatenation node, link the NFAs of the children in sequence.
    // - For an alternation node (e.g., A | B), create a new start state with epsilon transitions to the NFAs for each alternative,
    //   then combine their accepting states with epsilon transitions to a new accepting state.
    // - For a grouping node, simply build the NFA for its contents.
    // - For a quantifier node, build the NFA for the base pattern and then add loops or unroll as necessary:
    //   * For '*' (zero or more), add epsilon transition from start to accepting state and a loop back.
    //   * For '+' (one or more), require one occurrence and then loop.
    //   * For '{n, m}', unroll n transitions and then add additional states with limited loops up to m.
    // - For an exclusion node, mark the subpattern to be excluded in output (the NFA should consume the row but not output it).
    nfa = recursivelyBuildNFA(patternAST)
    return nfa

function convertNFAtoDFA(nfa: NFA) -> DFA
    // Use subset construction:
    //   - Each DFA state is a set of NFA states (epsilon closure included).
    //   - Build transitions for each input symbol.
    //   - Minimize the DFA (optional, but beneficial for performance).
    dfa = subsetConstruction(nfa)
    return dfa

function matchPattern(dfaOrNFA: StateMachine, rows: List<Row>, conditions: Map<String, ExpressionIR>, context: MatchContext) -> List<Match>
    // Iterate over rows in the partition:
    matches = []
    i = 0
    while i < length(rows):
        context.resetMatch()
        j = i
        while j < length(rows) and stateMachineCanAdvance(dfaOrNFA, rows[j]):
            // For each transition, evaluate the corresponding DEFINE condition:
            for each expected pattern variable in currentTransition:
                if not evaluateCondition(conditions[patternVariable], rows[j], context.getPreviousMatch()):
                    break out and try next row
            context.addRow(rows[j])
            if stateMachineReachedAcceptingState(dfaOrNFA):
                matches.add(context.currentMatch)
                break
            j = j + 1
        // Advance i based on AFTER MATCH SKIP strategy (e.g., i = i + 1 or i = indexAfterLastRow)
        i = updateStartIndex(i, context, dfaOrNFA, afterMatchOption)
    return matches
Notes:
– The NFA/DFA construction uses well–known techniques.
– The matching loop evaluates the conditions (from the DEFINE clause) for each row as it transitions between states.
– The MatchContext is updated with which pattern variable each row matched (for use in navigation functions and measure evaluation).
– The skip strategy (e.g., SKIP TO NEXT ROW) must be integrated here




4. Execution Engine


function runMatchRecognize(query: String, inputData: DataFrame) -> DataFrame
    // Step 1: Parse SQL to get the AST
    ast = parseSQL(query)
    
    // Step 2: Extract clauses from AST:
    partitionCols = ast.getPartitionByColumns()
    orderCols = ast.getOrderByColumns()   // Each element: (column, direction)
    measures = ast.getMeasures()          // Map measure alias -> (function, argument)
    patternAST = ast.getPatternAST()
    conditionsExpr = ast.getDefineConditions()  // Map variable -> condition expression (as string)
    subsets = ast.getSubsetMapping()              // e.g., { "U": ["A", "B"] }
    afterMatchOption = ast.getAfterMatchOption()  // e.g., "SKIP TO NEXT ROW"
    rowPerMatchOption = ast.getRowPerMatchOption()  // "ONE" or "ALL"
    
    // Step 3: Compile measure expressions and DEFINE conditions
    compiledMeasures = {}
    for alias, (func, arg) in measures:
        if arg is not '*' then:
            compiledMeasures[alias] = (func, compileExpression(arg))
        else:
            compiledMeasures[alias] = (func, arg)
    
    compiledConditions = {}
    for variable, condition in conditionsExpr:
        compiledConditions[variable] = compileExpression(condition)
    
    // Step 4: Preprocess pattern (expand subset tokens)
    patternString = ast.getPatternString()
    if subsets is not empty:
        patternString = expandSubsets(patternString, subsets)
    
    // Step 5: Partition input data
    partitions = partitionData(inputData, partitionCols)
    
    outputMatches = []
    for each partition in partitions:
        sortedRows = sortRows(partition, orderCols)  // Use type-aware sorting with ASC/DESC
        // Build NFA from pattern AST
        nfa = buildNFA(patternAST)  
        // Optionally convert to DFA: dfa = convertNFAtoDFA(nfa)
        // For each partition, create a new MatchContext
        context = new MatchContext(matchNumber=..., rowPerMatch=rowPerMatchOption, afterMatch=afterMatchOption)
        matches = matchPattern(nfa, sortedRows, compiledConditions, context)
        for match in matches:
            // Evaluate measures for each match
            if rowPerMatchOption == "ONE":
                resultRow = evaluateMeasures(compiledMeasures, match, context, mode="FINAL")
                resultRow.addPartitionColumns(partition.key)
                outputMatches.add(resultRow)
            else if rowPerMatchOption == "ALL":
                // For running measures, compute per row in match.
                finalMeasures = evaluateMeasures(compiledMeasures, match, context, mode="FINAL")
                for i from 0 to length(match)-1:
                    runningMeasures = evaluateMeasures(compiledMeasures, match[0..i], context, mode="RUNNING")
                    resultRow = merge(match[i], partition.key, runningMeasures, finalMeasures)
                    outputMatches.add(resultRow)
    
    return DataFrame(outputMatches)


Notes:
– partitionData() groups rows by partition columns.
– sortRows() uses order definitions (ASC/DESC) and converts data types appropriately.
– evaluateMeasures() uses the compiled measure expressions to compute outputs from the match.
– merge() constructs the output row from partition columns, input row data, and computed measures. 
– The engine keeps track of performance stats and logs diagnostic information.



5. Error Handling & Logging
Throughout every module, add try/catch blocks and logging:
try:
    // parsing, compiling, matching, or evaluation code
catch ParseError as pe:
    log.error("Parse error: " + pe.message + " in query: " + querySnippet)
    raise
catch ExpressionEvaluationError as ee:
    log.error("Expression evaluation failed: " + ee.message + " in context: " + contextInfo)
    // Optionally, return an error code or fallback
catch PatternMatchError as pme:
    log.error("Pattern matching error: " + pme.message)
    // Continue processing or abort based on severity



Summary
This detailed pseudocode outlines how you can structure a production-grade MATCH_RECOGNIZE engine:

Parsing: Use a full grammar to build an AST with all clauses.
Expression Evaluation: Compile expressions into an IR and evaluate with a context that includes running or final match data.
Pattern Matching: Construct an NFA from the pattern AST (and optionally convert it to DFA), and use it to match rows from sorted partitions while applying DEFINE conditions.
Execution: Partition and sort data, run the matcher on each partition, evaluate measures per match (or per row in ALL ROWS mode), and assemble output rows.
Error Handling: Provide comprehensive error messages and logging at every step.
This architecture is modular and extensible and would form a solid foundation for a production-grade engine with further optimizations and refinements.

Would you like to dive into more specific pseudocode details for any particular module?




. Modular Design

SQL Parser Module:
Use a mature parser generator (e.g., ANTLR) to support the full SQL MATCH_RECOGNIZE syntax.

Build a complete Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents all subclauses (PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, MEASURES, PATTERN, DEFINE, SUBSET, AFTER MATCH SKIP, etc.).
Include thorough validations for pattern variables and measure expressions.
Expression Evaluation Module:
Develop or integrate a robust expression evaluator to safely parse and evaluate conditions and measure expressions.

Support complex boolean and arithmetic expressions.
Handle navigation functions (e.g., PREV, NEXT, FIRST, LAST) with both running and final semantics.
Precompile expressions and cache them for efficient repeated evaluations.
Pattern Matching Engine:
Implement an advanced matching engine that constructs an NFA from the parsed AST and—where beneficial—converts it to a DFA.

Support all pattern operators: concatenation, alternation, grouping, permutation, quantifiers (including exact and range), exclusions, and subset definitions.
Optimize with epsilon closure caching, state minimization, and transition table precomputation.
Provide options for overlapping (AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW/FIRST/LAST) and non-overlapping matches.
Execution Engine:
Integrate the parser, expression evaluator, and pattern matcher to process the input DataFrame.

Partition data by PARTITION BY columns and sort each partition based on ORDER BY (with support for ASC/DESC and data–type aware sorting).
Apply the matching engine on each partition, evaluate measures, and produce output rows based on ONE ROW PER MATCH or ALL ROWS PER MATCH semantics.
Maintain performance statistics and detailed logging.
Error Handling & Diagnostics:
Implement comprehensive error handling across modules:

Provide detailed error messages (including context, hints, and error codes) for syntax errors, ambiguous patterns, and runtime matching issues.
Use logging frameworks with configurable verbosity levels for both debugging and production monitoring.
2. Detailed Component Enhancements
A. SQL Parser Enhancements
Full Grammar Support:
Extend the grammar to handle nested expressions, multiple conditions (AND, OR, NOT), and complex measure expressions.

Subset & Skip Options:

Parse the SUBSET clause and expand subset tokens (e.g., replace a subset variable with an alternation of its members).
Recognize and store advanced AFTER MATCH SKIP options (e.g., SKIP TO FIRST A, SKIP TO LAST B).
AST Generation:
Generate a detailed AST that feeds directly into the matching engine and the expression evaluator.

B. Expression Evaluation Improvements
Robust Expression Parser:
Use a dedicated parser (or a safe library) to handle arithmetic and boolean expressions beyond simple regex–based matching.

Support nested navigation functions and compound conditions.
Precompile and cache parsed expressions to improve runtime performance.
Context–Sensitive Evaluation:
Ensure that expressions in the DEFINE and MEASURES clauses can reference:

The entire match (final semantics) or the growing match (running semantics).
Specific pattern variables, by filtering the match rows accordingly.
Security & Efficiency:
Avoid using insecure methods like direct eval; instead, compile expressions into an intermediate representation (IR) that’s safely executed.

C. Pattern Matching Engine Enhancements
Advanced NFA/DFA Construction:

Build the NFA from the AST while supporting the full range of operators (quantifiers, alternation, exclusions, grouping).
For performance-critical paths, convert the NFA to a DFA where possible.
Implement state minimization techniques to reduce the number of states.
Optimized Matching:

Cache epsilon closures and state transitions.
Use incremental matching to avoid reprocessing input rows, especially on large datasets.
Consider multi-threading for processing different partitions in parallel.
Comprehensive Skip Logic:
Adjust the engine to correctly implement all AFTER MATCH SKIP options:

For SKIP PAST LAST ROW: resume from the row immediately after the match.
For SKIP TO NEXT ROW/FIRST/LAST: resume based on the matched variable’s position.
D. Execution Engine Enhancements
Partitioning and Ordering:
Enhance the ORDER BY processing to support sort directions (ASC/DESC) and perform type–aware sorting (e.g., numeric and date types).
Measure Evaluation:
Distinguish between running and final measures; compute final measures once per match and reuse them across output rows.
Support aggregations that are scoped to specific pattern variables.
Robust Integration:
Tie together the parser, expression evaluator, and pattern matcher into a single cohesive engine that can handle production loads.
E. Error Handling & Logging
Diagnostic Enhancements:
Use detailed log messages and error contexts in all modules.
Provide fallback and safe–exit strategies for ambiguous patterns.
Test Coverage:
Develop an extensive test suite covering edge cases, complex nested expressions, and ambiguous pattern constructs.
Use performance benchmarking tools to profile and optimize matching speed.
3. Implementation Considerations
Scalability:
Consider designing the engine to work with streaming data or integrate with distributed computing frameworks if needed.

Modularity:
Keep the SQL parser, expression evaluator, and pattern matcher loosely coupled so that improvements in one area (e.g., swapping out the expression evaluator) do not require rewriting the entire system.

Integration:
Provide a clear API for external callers (e.g., a method that accepts a SQL query string and a DataFrame, and returns a new DataFrame with matched results).

Security & Robustness:
Validate all inputs rigorously. Use sandboxing for expression evaluations to prevent arbitrary code execution.
