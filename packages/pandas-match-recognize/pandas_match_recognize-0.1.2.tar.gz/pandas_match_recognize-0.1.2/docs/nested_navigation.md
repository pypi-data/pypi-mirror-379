# Nested Navigation Functions in SQL Pattern Recognition

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of nested navigation functions in the SQL pattern recognition feature, specifically focusing on the `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` clause. Nested navigation functions allow for complex pattern matching by combining multiple navigation operations, such as `PREV(FIRST(A.price, 3), 2)`.

## Supported Navigation Functions

The implementation supports the following navigation functions:

1. **FIRST(variable.field [, occurrence])**: Returns the value of the field from the first (or nth) occurrence of the variable.
2. **LAST(variable.field [, occurrence])**: Returns the value of the field from the last (or nth from the end) occurrence of the variable.
3. **PREV(variable.field [, steps])**: Returns the value of the field from the row that is steps rows before the current row.
4. **NEXT(variable.field [, steps])**: Returns the value of the field from the row that is steps rows after the current row.

## Nested Navigation Syntax

Nested navigation functions follow this syntax:

```sql
OUTER_FUNCTION(INNER_FUNCTION(variable.field [, inner_arg]) [, outer_arg])
```

For example:
- `PREV(FIRST(A.price, 3), 2)`: The value of the 3rd occurrence of A.price going back 2 steps.
- `NEXT(LAST(B.quantity))`: The next value after the last B.quantity.
- `FIRST(PREV(C.value, 1))`: The first occurrence of the previous value of C.value.

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of several key components:

1. **Recursive Evaluation**: Nested functions are evaluated recursively, evaluating the innermost function first, then applying the outer function to the result.

2. **Caching**: To improve performance, results are cached using a comprehensive cache key that includes partition information.

3. **Error Handling**: The implementation handles various error conditions, such as references beyond available rows or partition boundaries.

4. **Partition Boundary Enforcement**: Navigation functions respect partition boundaries to ensure consistent behavior across partitions.

5. **Support for Arguments**: Both inner and outer functions can have arguments, which are properly handled in the evaluation.

## Key Features

1. **Production-Ready Performance**: The implementation includes caching, error handling, and performance metrics.

2. **Comprehensive Support**: All valid combinations of navigation functions are supported.

3. **Semantic Consistency**: The implementation follows SQL:2016 standard semantics for pattern matching.

4. **Optimized Memory Usage**: Avoids redundant computations through effective caching.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use nested navigation functions in SQL queries:

```sql
-- Find price patterns with nested navigation
SELECT *
FROM stock_data
MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
    PARTITION BY symbol
    ORDER BY timestamp
    MEASURES 
        PREV(FIRST(A.price), 1) AS prev_first_price,
        NEXT(LAST(B.volume), 1) AS next_last_volume,
        FIRST(PREV(C.price, 1)) AS first_prev_price
    PATTERN (A B C)
    DEFINE
        A AS price > PREV(price),
        B AS price > PREV(price),
        C AS price < PREV(price)
)
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite is available in `tests/test_nested_navigation.py` which covers:

1. Simple navigation functions
2. Nested navigation functions
3. Complex nested navigation with multiple levels
4. Navigation with arguments
5. Error handling for invalid navigation

## Technical Implementation

The core implementation is in the `evaluate_nested_navigation` function in `src/matcher/condition_evaluator.py`. This function recursively evaluates nested navigation expressions and handles all the complexities of navigating through the pattern matches.

Additionally, the `_build_navigation_expr` method supports converting AST navigation function calls to string representation, which is essential for properly handling complex nested navigation patterns.

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

1. Support for more complex expressions within navigation functions.
2. Enhanced validation for navigation function combinations.
3. Improved performance for deeply nested navigation functions.
4. Integration with more complex pattern recognition features.
