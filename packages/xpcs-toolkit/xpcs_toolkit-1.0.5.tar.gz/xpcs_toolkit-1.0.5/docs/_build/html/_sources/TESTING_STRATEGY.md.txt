# Test Categorization and Management Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the test categorization strategy for the XPCS Toolkit, designed to manage the comprehensive test suite while providing flexibility for different development and CI environments.

## Test Categories

### Core Test Markers

- **`unit`** - Unit tests for individual components
- **`integration`** - Integration tests across multiple components
- **`scientific`** - Tests that verify scientific accuracy and algorithms
- **`data_integrity`** - Tests that verify data accuracy and corruption handling

### Environment-Dependent Test Markers

- **`system_dependent`** - Tests that depend on system resources or environment
- **`stress`** - Resource exhaustion and extreme load tests
- **`memory`** - Memory usage and leak detection tests
- **`flaky`** - Tests that may fail intermittently due to external factors

### Specialized Test Markers

- **`edge_cases`** - Boundary conditions and extreme input tests
- **`performance`** - Performance and benchmark tests
- **`slow`** - Tests that take more than 1 second
- **`error_handling`** - Tests for error conditions and edge cases
- **`threading`** - Multithreading and async operation tests

## Test Execution Profiles

### Development Environment
```bash
# Run core tests only (fast feedback)
pytest -m "unit or integration"

# Run everything except stress tests
pytest -m "not stress"

# Run everything except system-dependent tests
pytest -m "not system_dependent"
```

### CI Environment
```bash
# Skip flaky and system-dependent tests for stable CI
pytest -m "not (stress or system_dependent or flaky)"

# Run only core functionality tests
pytest -m "(unit or integration) and not slow"
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
# Run everything (may take a long time and require specific system setup)
pytest

# Run only stress tests (for performance validation)
pytest -m "stress"

# Run only edge case tests
pytest -m "edge_cases"
```

## Test Skipping Strategy

### Automatic Skipping

Tests are automatically skipped based on system conditions:

1. **Memory Tests**: Skipped on systems with >4GB available RAM
2. **Network Tests**: Skipped if network socket support is unavailable
3. **Disk Space Tests**: Skipped if insufficient disk space for simulation
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Skipped on systems where resource limits cannot be enforced

### Manual Skipping

Environment variables can be used to control test execution:

```bash
# Skip all stress tests
export SKIP_STRESS_TESTS=1
pytest

# Skip memory-intensive tests
export SKIP_MEMORY_TESTS=1
pytest

# Skip tests requiring special hardware
export SKIP_HARDWARE_TESTS=1
pytest
```

## Test Categories by Purpose

### Scientific Accuracy (Always Run)
- Data integrity validation
- Algorithm correctness
- Numerical precision tests
- HDF5 data format compliance

### System Robustness (Run When Applicable)
- Memory pressure handling
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Network failure simulation

### Performance Validation (Optional)
- Benchmark tests
- Memory leak detection
- Large dataset processing
- Concurrent access patterns

## Recommendations

### For Developers
1. **Regular Development**: Run `pytest -m "unit or integration"`
2. **Before Commit**: Run `pytest -m "not (stress or system_dependent)"`
3. **Full Validation**: Run `pytest` (allow extra time)

### For CI/CD Pipelines
1. **Pull Request Checks**: `pytest -m "not (stress or system_dependent or flaky)"`
2. **Nightly Builds**: `pytest -m "not flaky"`
3. **Release Validation**: `pytest` (full suite)

### For Users
1. **Quick Verification**: `pytest -m "unit"`
2. **Installation Test**: `pytest -m "integration"`
3. **Full System Test**: `pytest -m "not flaky"` (if time permits)

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Review skipped tests quarterly** to assess if they can be re-enabled
2. **Update skip conditions** as system requirements change
3. **Document new test categories** when adding specialized tests
4. **Monitor flaky tests** and either fix or permanently skip them

## Test File Organization

- **Core functionality**: `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`
- **Error handling**: `tests/error_handling/`
- **Performance tests**: `tests/performance/`
- **End-to-end workflows**: `tests/end_to_end/`
- **GUI tests**: `tests/gui_interactive/`

## Future Considerations

1. **Containerized testing** for consistent environments
2. **Matrix testing** across different Python versions and dependencies
3. **Hardware-specific test suites** for different deployment targets
4. **Automated test result analysis** to identify consistently failing tests
