## Demo

Using tenrec and Claude Code, we were able to solve Challenge 4 from Flare-On 9 (darn mice) with a single prompt (see below).
Find the complete challenge write-up [here](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/04-darn-mice.pdf).


> You have been provided with the binary called darn_mice.exe in the current directory. Use 
tenrec to open a session and reverse the binary. Focus on getting a high-level 
understanding of the application by finding entry points, and tracing execution flow. 
Make sure to rename variables and functions as you work through the binary. The xref 
plugin can be helpful in this task. You will ultimately be looking for a flag. The flag 
is formatted in an email format, and may require decryption. Do not try to guess the 
flag, use your analysis to guide you towards the correct answer based on the binary.
