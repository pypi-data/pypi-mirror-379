**DLKoopman: A general-purpose Python package for Koopman theory using deep learning**.

Koopman theory is a technique to encode sampled data (aka states) of a nonlinear dynamical system into a linear domain. This is very powerful as a linear model can:
- Give insight into the dynamics via eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- Leverage linear algebra techniques to easily analyze the system and predict its behavior under unknown conditions.


## Why DLKoopman?
*DLKoopman uses deep learning to learn an encoding of a nonlinear dynamical system into a linear domain, while simultaneously learning the dynamics of the linear model*. DLKoopman bridges the gap between:
- Software packages that restrict the learning of a good encoding (e.g. [`pykoopman`](https://github.com/dynamicslab/pykoopman)), and
- Efforts that learn encodings for specific applications instead of being a general-purpose tool (e.g. [`DeepKoopman`](https://github.com/BethanyL/DeepKoopman)).

### Key DLKoopman features
- State prediction (`StatePred`) - Train on individual states of a system, then predict unknown states.
    - E.g: What is the pressure vector on this aircraft for $23.5^{\circ}$ angle of attack?
- Trajectory prediction (`TrajPred`) - Train on generated trajectories of a system, then predict unknown trajectories for new initial states.
    - E.g: What is the behavior of this pendulum if I start from the point $[1,-1]$?
- General-purpose and reusable - supports data from any dynamical system.
- Novel error function Average Normalized Absolute Error (ANAE) for visualizing performance.
- Extensive options and a ready-to-use hyperparameter search module to improve performance.
- Built using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), supports both CPU and GPU platforms.

## Description 

### Koopman theory
Assume a dynamical system $x_{i+1} = F(x_i)$, where $x$ is the (generally multi-dimensional) state of the system at index $i$, and $F$ is the (generally nonlinear) evolution rule describing the dynamics of the system. Koopman theory attempts to *encode* $x$ into a different space $y = g(x)$ where the dynamics are linear, i.e. $y_{i+1} = Ky_i$, where $K$ is the Koopman matrix. This is incredibly powerful since the state $y_i$ at any index $i$ can be predicted from the initial state $y_0$ as $y_i = K^iy_0$. This is then *decoded* back into the original space as $x = g^{-1}(y)$.

For a thorough mathematical treatment, see [this technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07561).

### dlkoopman training

This is a small example with three *input states* $\left[x_0, x_1, x_2\right]$. These are passed through an encoder neural network to get *encoded states* $\left[y_0, y_1, y_2\right]$. These are used to learn $K$, and also passed through a decoder neural network to get *decoded states* $\left[\hat{x}_0, \hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2\right]$. The Koopman matrix $K$ is used to derive *predicted encoded states* $\left[\textsf{y}_1, \textsf{y}_2\right]$, which are then passed through the same decoder to get *predicted decoded states* $\left[\hat{\textsf{x}}_1, \hat{\textsf{x}}_2\right]$ as approximations to the original input states.

Errors mimimized during training:
- Train the autoencoder - Reconstruction `recon` between input states $x$ and decoded states $\hat{x}$.
- Train the Koopman matrix - Linearity `lin` between encoded states $y$ and predicted encoded states $\textsf{y}$.
- Combine the above - Prediction `pred` between input states $x$ and predicted decoded states $\hat{\textsf{x}}$.

Prediction happens after training.

(a) State prediction - Compute predicted states for new indexes such as $i'$. This uses the eigendecomposition of $K$, so $i'$ can be any real number - positive (forward extapolation), negative (backward extrapolation), or fractional (interpolation).

(b) Trajectory prediction - Generate predicted trajectories $j'$ for new starting states such as $x^{j'}_0$. This uses a linear neural net layer to evolve the initial state.
