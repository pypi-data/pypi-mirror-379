def anae(ref, new) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Average Normalized Absolute Error (ANAE).
    
    ANAE first normalizes each absolute deviation by the corresponding absolute ground truth, then averages them. This is a useful thing to report since it tells us how much percentage deviation to expect for a new value. E.g. if prediction ANAE for a problem is around 10%, then one can expect a newly predicted value to have an error of around 10% from the actual.
    
    Example: Let
    ```python
    ref = torch.tensor([[-0.1,0.2,0],[100,200,300]])
    new = torch.tensor([[-0.11,0.15,0.01],[105,210,285]])
    ```

    $$ANAE = \\text{Avg}\\left(\\frac{|-0.1-(-0.11)|}{|-0.1|}, \\frac{|0.2-0.15|}{|0.15|}, \\frac{|100-105|}{|100|}, \\frac{|200-210|}{|200|}, \\frac{|300-285|}{|300|}\\right) = 10\\%$$
    Note that:
    
    - Ground truth value of \\(0\\) is ignored. 
    
    - ANAE heavily penalizes deviations for small values of ground truth.

    ## Parameters
    **ref** (*torch.Tensor*) and **new** (*torch.Tensor*) - Error will be calculated between these tensors.

    ## Returns
    **anae** (*torch scalar*) - In percentage.

    NAAE first averages the absolute error, then normalizes that using the average value of the absolute ground truth. This reduces the chance of a few small ground truth values having a huge impact, but loses details by taking the average over all absolute error values, and likewise over all ground truth values.
    
    Example: Let `ref = torch.tensor([[-0.1,0.2,0],[100,200,300]]), new = torch.tensor([[-0.11,0.15,0.01],[105,210,285]])`.

    ## Returns

    ## Caution
    NAAE is experimental, so it is best to stick with ANAE for now.
