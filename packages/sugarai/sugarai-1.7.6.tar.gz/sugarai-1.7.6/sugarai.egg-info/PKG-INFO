# Sugar - AI-Powered Autonomous Development System

**An intelligent autonomous development assistant that works 24/7 to improve your codebase using Claude AI.**

Sugar is a lightweight autonomous development system specifically designed for Claude Code CLI integration that can be installed as a library in any project. It continuously discovers work from GitHub issues, error logs, and code quality analysis, then automatically implements fixes and improvements using Claude's advanced reasoning capabilities.

## ✨ What Makes Sugar Special

- 🤖 **Truly Autonomous**: Runs 24/7 discovering and fixing issues without human intervention
- 🧠 **Advanced Agent Integration**: Intelligently selects optimal Claude agents for each task type
- 🚀 **Dynamic Agent Discovery**: Works with **any** Claude agents you have configured locally
- 🔍 **Smart Discovery**: Automatically finds work from GitHub issues, error logs, and code analysis
- 🎯 **Project-Focused**: Each project gets isolated Sugar instance with custom configuration
- 🔧 **Battle-Tested**: Handles real development workflows with git, GitHub, testing, and deployment
- 📊 **Quality Tracking**: Monitors agent performance with detailed analytics and confidence scoring
- 📈 **Learning System**: Adapts and improves based on success/failure patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Required:** Sugar requires Claude Code CLI to be installed and accessible.

1. **Install Claude Code CLI** (if not already installed):
   - Visit [Claude Code CLI documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for installation instructions
   - Or install via npm: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code-cli`
   - Verify installation: `claude --version`

2. **Ensure Claude CLI is in your PATH** or note its location for configuration

⚠️ **Important:** Sugar is designed to run **outside** of Claude Code sessions. Run Sugar directly in your terminal/shell, not within a Claude Code session. Sugar will call Claude Code CLI as needed to execute tasks.

### Installation

**Install from PyPI (recommended):**

```bash
pip install sugarai
```

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: By installing and using Sugar, you agree to the [Terms of Service and Disclaimer](TERMS.md). Sugar is provided "AS IS" without warranty. Users are solely responsible for reviewing AI-generated code and ensuring appropriate safeguards. Sugar is not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic, Inc. "Claude" and "Claude Code" are trademarks of Anthropic, Inc.

**Or install from source for latest development version:**

```bash
# Method 1: Clone and install (recommended for development)
git clone https://github.com/cdnsteve/sugar.git
cd sugar
pip install -e .

# Method 2: Direct from Git (SSH) - Always use main branch
pip install -e git+ssh://git@github.com/cdnsteve/sugar.git@main#egg=sugar
```

📖 **Detailed setup instructions:** [Local Development Setup](docs/dev/local-development.md)

### Initialize in Your Project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
sugar init
```

**Note:** Sugar will auto-detect your Claude CLI installation. If it's not in your PATH, you can specify the location in `.sugar/config.yaml` after initialization.

### Add Some Work

```bash
sugar add "Implement user authentication" --type feature --priority 4
sugar add "Fix memory leak in auth module" --type bug_fix --urgent
sugar add "Add unit tests for payments" --type test --priority 3
```

### Get Help Anytime

```bash
# Comprehensive help and quick reference
sugar help

# Command-specific help
sugar add --help
sugar run --help
```

### Start Autonomous Development

```bash
# Test with dry run first
sugar run --dry-run --once

# Start 24/7 autonomous operation
sugar run
```

## 🎯 What Sugar Does

Sugar operates in **two modes**:

### 🤖 Autonomous Discovery
Sugar continuously:
- 🔍 **Discovers work** from error logs, feedback, and GitHub issues
- 📊 **Analyzes code quality** and identifies improvements  
- 🧪 **Detects missing tests** and coverage gaps
- ⚡ **Executes tasks** using Claude Code CLI with full context
- 🌿 **Creates branches & PRs** or commits directly to main (configurable)
- 💬 **Updates GitHub issues** with detailed progress and completion status
- 🧠 **Learns and adapts** from results to improve future performance
- 🔄 **Repeats autonomously** 24/7 without human intervention

### 👤 Manual Task Management
You can also directly add tasks:
- 📝 **Add specific tasks** via `sugar add "task description"`
- 🎯 **Set priorities** and task types (bug_fix, feature, test, etc.)
- 📋 **Manage work queue** with full CLI control
- 🔄 **Combined workflow** - manual tasks + autonomous discovery

## 📁 Clean Project Structure 

Sugar keeps everything contained in `.sugar/` directory - no clutter in your project root!

```
your-project/
├── src/                    # Your project source
├── .sugar/                  # Sugar-specific files (isolated)

## 🤖 Claude Agent Integration

**Sugar v1.2.0+ includes advanced Claude agent integration with dynamic agent discovery!**

Sugar intelligently selects the best Claude agent for each task based on work characteristics, and supports **any agents you have configured locally** - not just built-in ones.

### 🎯 Intelligent Agent Selection

Sugar automatically analyzes your work items and selects the optimal agent:

```bash
# High-priority security bug → tech-lead agent
sugar add --type bug_fix --priority 5 --title "Critical auth vulnerability"

# Code refactoring → code-reviewer agent  
sugar add --type refactor --title "Clean up legacy payment code"

# Social media content → social-media-growth-strategist agent
sugar add --type documentation --title "Create LinkedIn content for developer audience"

# Standard feature → general-purpose agent
sugar add --type feature --title "Add user profile settings"
```

### 🔧 Agent Configuration

Configure agents in `.sugar/config.yaml`:

```yaml
claude:
  # Structured Request System
  use_structured_requests: true
  
  # Agent Selection System
  enable_agents: true        # Enable agent mode selection
  agent_fallback: true       # Fall back to basic Claude if agent fails
  
  # Map work types to specific agents (built-in or custom)
  agent_selection:
    bug_fix: "tech-lead"                    # Built-in agent
    feature: "my-frontend-specialist"       # Your custom agent
    refactor: "code-reviewer"               # Built-in agent  
    test: "general-purpose"                 # Built-in agent
    documentation: "technical-writer"       # Your custom agent
  
  # Dynamic Agent Discovery - specify your available agents
  available_agents: [
    "tech-lead",                 # Built-in agents
    "code-reviewer", 
    "general-purpose",
    "my-frontend-specialist",    # Your custom agents
    "technical-writer",
    "database-expert",
    "security-specialist"
  ]
  
  # If available_agents is empty/unspecified, Sugar accepts any agent name
```

### 🌟 Built-in Agent Types

Sugar includes intelligent selection for these built-in agents:

| Agent | Best For | Keywords |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **tech-lead** | Strategic analysis, architecture, complex bugs, high-priority work | architecture, design, strategy, security, critical |
| **code-reviewer** | Code quality, refactoring, optimization, best practices | review, refactor, cleanup, optimize, code quality |
| **social-media-growth-strategist** | Content strategy, engagement, audience growth | social media, content, engagement, followers |
| **general-purpose** | Standard development work (features, tests, docs) | Default for most tasks |
| **statusline-setup** | Claude Code status line configuration | statusline, status line |
| **output-style-setup** | Claude Code output styling and themes | output style, styling, theme |

### 🚀 Custom Agent Support

**Sugar supports ANY agents you have configured locally!** Examples:

```yaml
claude:
  agent_selection:
    bug_fix: "my-security-expert"      # Your custom security agent
    feature: "frontend-guru"           # Your custom frontend agent
    refactor: "performance-wizard"     # Your custom performance agent
    database: "sql-specialist"        # Your custom database agent
```

### 🧠 How Agent Selection Works

1. **User Configuration First**: Checks your `agent_selection` mapping
2. **Keyword Analysis**: Uses intelligent keyword matching as fallback
3. **Availability Validation**: Ensures selected agent is in your `available_agents` list  
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to available alternatives if needed
5. **Quality Assessment**: Tracks agent performance with 0.0-1.0 quality scores

### 📊 Agent Performance Tracking

Sugar provides detailed analytics for agent performance:

```bash
# View work with timing and agent information
sugar list
# 📋 20 Tasks (16 pending ⏳, 2 completed ✅, 1 active ⚡, 1 failed ❌):
# ⏱️ 45.2s | 🕐 2m 15s | 🤖 tech-lead | Critical auth fix

sugar view TASK_ID
# Shows: agent used, quality score, confidence level, execution time
```

### 🔄 Fallback Strategy

Sugar uses a robust multi-layer fallback system:

1. **Selected Agent** (from configuration or keyword analysis)
2. **Basic Claude** (if agent fails)  
3. **Legacy Mode** (if structured requests fail)

This ensures your work **never fails** due to agent issues.

### ⚙️ Migration from v1.1.x

Existing Sugar installations automatically get agent support with **zero breaking changes**:

- All existing configurations continue working unchanged
- Agents are **opt-in** - set `enable_agents: false` to disable
- Without agent configuration, Sugar uses intelligent defaults

## 📋 Command Reference

### Task Management
```bash
# Add tasks with different types and priorities
sugar add "Task title" [--type TYPE] [--priority 1-5] [--urgent] [--description DESC]

# Types: bug_fix, feature, test, refactor, documentation
# Priority: 1 (low) to 5 (urgent)

# List tasks
sugar list [--status STATUS] [--type TYPE] [--limit N]

# View specific task details
sugar view TASK_ID

# Update existing task
sugar update TASK_ID [--title TITLE] [--description DESC] [--priority 1-5] [--type TYPE] [--status STATUS]

# Remove task
sugar remove TASK_ID

# Check system status
sugar status
```

### 🆕 Complex Data Input (v1.7.6+)

Sugar now supports **rich JSON task data** for seamless Claude Code integration:

```bash
# 📁 JSON file input - perfect for complex tasks
sugar add "API Implementation" --input-file /path/to/task.json

# 📥 Stdin input - ideal for Claude Code slash commands
echo '{"priority": 5, "context": {"complexity": "high"}}' | sugar add "Critical Fix" --stdin

# 🔧 JSON description parsing - structured task descriptions
sugar add "Database Migration" --json --description '{"tables": ["users"], "rollback": true}'
```

**Benefits for external tool integration:**
- 🚫 **No shell escaping issues** - complex strings, quotes, and special characters work perfectly
- 📊 **Full data preservation** - nested objects, arrays, and metadata maintain structure
- 🤖 **Claude Code ready** - slash commands can pass rich task data without fragility
- 🔗 **Programmatic integration** - scripts and tools can create detailed tasks effortlessly

📖 **Complete examples and documentation:** [CLI Reference - Complex Data Input](docs/user/cli-reference.md#complex-data-examples)

### System Operation
```bash
# Initialize Sugar in current directory
sugar init [--project-dir PATH]

# Run autonomous loop
sugar run [--dry-run] [--once] [--validate]

# Validate configuration
sugar run --validate
```

## 🔄 Multi-Project Usage

Run Sugar across multiple projects simultaneously:

```bash
# Project A
cd /path/to/project-a
sugar init && sugar run &

# Project B  
cd /path/to/project-b
sugar init && sugar run &

# Project C
cd /path/to/project-c
sugar init && sugar run &
```

Each project operates independently with isolated:
- Configuration and database
- Work queues and execution
- Discovery and learning

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Dry run mode** - Simulates execution without making changes (default)
- **Path exclusions** - Prevents system file modifications  
- **Project isolation** - Uses `.sugar/` directory to avoid conflicts
- **Timeout handling** - Prevents runaway processes
- **Auto-detection** - Finds Claude CLI automatically
- **Graceful shutdown** - Handles interrupts cleanly

## 💾 Storage & Context

Sugar maintains project-specific data isolation:

- **Project Database**: `.sugar/sugar.db` stores all task data, execution history, and learning
- **Context Management**: `.sugar/context.json` preserves Claude Code session context
- **Automated Backups**: Regular database backups with configurable intervals
- **Isolated Logs**: Project-specific logging in `.sugar/sugar.log`

Each Sugar instance is completely isolated - you can run multiple projects simultaneously without interference.

## 🔍 Work Input Methods

Sugar accepts work from **multiple sources**:

### 📝 Manual CLI Input
Direct task management via command line:
```bash
sugar add "Implement user registration" --type feature --priority 4
sugar add "Fix authentication bug" --type bug_fix --urgent
sugar add "Add API tests" --type test --priority 3
```

### 🤖 Autonomous Discovery
Sugar automatically finds work from:

### Error Logs
Monitors specified directories for error files:
```yaml
discovery:
  error_logs:
    paths: ["logs/errors/", "app/logs/"]
    patterns: ["*.json", "*.log"]
```

### Code Quality Analysis
Scans source code for improvements:
```yaml
discovery:
  code_quality:
    file_extensions: [".py", ".js", ".ts"]
    excluded_dirs: ["node_modules", "venv"]
```

### Test Coverage Analysis
Identifies missing tests:
```yaml
discovery:
  test_coverage:
    source_dirs: ["src", "lib"]
    test_dirs: ["tests", "spec"]
```

### GitHub Integration (Optional)
Monitors repository issues and PRs:
```yaml
discovery:
  github:
    enabled: true
    repo: "owner/repository"
    token: "ghp_your_token"
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Per-Project Monitoring

Each project has its own isolated Sugar instance. Commands are project-specific:

```bash
# Check status for current project
sugar status

# Monitor logs for current project
tail -f .sugar/sugar.log

# List recent work for current project (shows status summary)
sugar list --status completed --limit 10

# Background operation for current project
nohup sugar run > sugar-autonomous.log 2>&1 &
```

### Multi-Project Monitoring

To monitor Sugar across multiple projects, you need to check each project directory:

```bash
# Example script to check all projects
for project in ~/projects/*; do
  if [ -d "$project/.sugar" ]; then
    echo "📂 Project: $(basename $project)"
    cd "$project"
    sugar status | grep -E "(Total Tasks|Pending|Active|Completed)"
    echo
  fi
done
```

## 🎛️ Advanced Usage

### Custom Error Integration

Configure Sugar to monitor your application's error logs:

```yaml
discovery:
  error_logs:
    paths:
      - "logs/errors/"
      - "monitoring/alerts/"
      - "var/log/myapp/"
```

### Team Workflow

1. Each developer runs Sugar locally
2. Share configuration templates (without tokens)
3. Different priorities for different team members
4. GitHub integration prevents duplicate work

### Production Deployment

- Test thoroughly in staging environments
- Monitor resource usage and performance
- Set appropriate concurrency and timeout limits
- Ensure rollback procedures are in place

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Claude CLI not found:**
```bash
# First, check if Claude CLI is installed
claude --version

# If not installed, install it:
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code-cli

# If installed but not found by Sugar, edit .sugar/config.yaml:
claude:
  command: "/full/path/to/claude"  # Specify exact path
```

**No work discovered:**
```bash
# Check paths exist
ls -la logs/errors/

# Validate configuration  
sugar run --validate

# Test with sample error
echo '{"error": "test"}' > logs/errors/test.json
```

**Tasks not executing:**
```bash
# Check dry_run setting
cat .sugar/config.yaml | grep dry_run

# Monitor logs
tail -f .sugar/sugar.log

# Test single cycle
sugar run --once
```
