Base library for creating new [DHTI](https://github.com/dermatologist/dhti) Elixirs.

[What is DHTI?](https://github.com/dermatologist/dhti) DHTI (Digital Health Tooling Interface) provides building blocks for interoperable, healthcare-focused AI tooling. This repository is the minimal foundation you extend to build your own "Elixir"—a reusable, testable component (chain/agent/server) that plugs into the wider DHTI ecosystem.

Status: WIP, but stable enough to scaffold new Elixirs and iterate quickly.

## Overview

This package exposes lightweight, composable base classes:

- `BaseChain` – a LangChain-compatible chain scaffold with sensible defaults.
- `BaseAgent` – an agent scaffold that can bind tools and work with LangGraph.
- `BaseGraph`, `BaseLLM`, `BaseServer`, `BaseSpace`, and `BaseDhtiModel` – helpers to organize more complex Elixirs.

Use these to rapidly create a new Elixir with a consistent structure, tests, and docs.


## Project layout

- `src/dhti_elixir_base/` – base classes and minimal utilities.
- `tests/` – example tests to keep your Elixir robust.
- `examples/` – quick patterns for chains/graphs.
