# Feature Specification: PDF Reader MCP Refactoring and PyPI Publication

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-mcp-pypi`  
**Created**: September 24, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "请你查看这个项目 由于一开始我使用ai来写的 现在有些乱 我希望你能帮我进行对该mcp的重构任务，同时发布到pypi上 用uvx pdfreadmcp这样的参数来运行该mcpserver。所有的工具不要变！然后该清理的内容清理，虚拟环境也清理，后面重新安装！请你开始！"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → ✅ Chinese request to refactor AI-generated messy MCP project
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Developer/User
   → Actions: Refactor, publish to PyPI, clean up, reinstall
   → Data: Existing MCP tools (unchanged)
   → Constraints: Keep all tools unchanged, enable uvx execution
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All requirements are clear from user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✅ Clear developer workflow for refactoring and publishing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✅ Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   → MCP Server, Tools, PyPI Package, Virtual Environment
7. Run Review Checklist
   → ✅ No implementation details, focused on business needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to clean up and professionalize an AI-generated PDF Reader MCP project by refactoring messy code, publishing it as a proper PyPI package, and enabling easy installation and execution through uvx tooling while preserving all existing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an existing messy MCP project with PDF tools, **When** refactoring is completed, **Then** the code structure should be clean and professional while maintaining all original tool functionality
2. **Given** a refactored MCP project, **When** published to PyPI, **Then** users should be able to install and run it using `uvx pdfreadmcp`
3. **Given** an existing virtual environment with dependencies, **When** cleanup is performed, **Then** the environment should be rebuilt cleanly with only necessary dependencies
4. **Given** the published package, **When** a user runs `uvx pdfreadmcp`, **Then** the MCP server should start successfully with all PDF processing tools available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the refactoring process encounters conflicting dependencies?
- How does the system handle missing or corrupted configuration files during cleanup?
- What occurs if PyPI publication fails due to naming conflicts or authentication issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST preserve all existing PDF processing tool functionality during refactoring
- **FR-002**: System MUST clean up and reorganize code structure to follow Python best practices
- **FR-003**: System MUST be publishable as a PyPI package with proper metadata and dependencies
- **FR-004**: System MUST be executable via `uvx pdfreadmcp` command after publication
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow complete virtual environment cleanup and fresh reinstallation
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain all current MCP server capabilities and tool interfaces
- **FR-007**: System MUST include proper package configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup metadata)
- **FR-008**: System MUST remove unnecessary files and clean up project structure
- **FR-009**: System MUST verify all tools work correctly after refactoring and publication
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear installation and usage instructions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MCP Server**: The main server process that hosts PDF processing tools and handles client communication
- **PDF Tools Collection**: Set of existing tools for PDF operations (reading, OCR, image conversion, metadata extraction, text search, optimization)
- **PyPI Package**: The published package containing the refactored MCP server and all dependencies
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python environment containing project dependencies
- **Configuration Files**: Project metadata and build configuration (pyproject.toml, mcp.json)
