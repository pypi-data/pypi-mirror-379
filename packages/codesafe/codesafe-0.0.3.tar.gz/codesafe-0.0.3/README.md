An open-source Python library for code encryption, decryption, and safe evaluation using Python's built-in AST module, complete with allowed functions, variables, built-in imports, timeouts, and blocked access to attributes.

*CodeSafe is an experimental library, and we're still running some tests on it. If you encounter any issues, or have an edge use case, please let us know.*

> [!NOTE]
> **CodeSafe** is intended to quickly encrypt/decrypt code files, and run them (only for Python script files) while in their encrypted form, but not as a means for powerful encryption, just code obfuscation. We have also included a `safe_eval` function, that can safely evaluate expressions within a safe environment.

### Changelog v0.0.3:
- Added an `allow_attributes` parameter to `safe_eval` and set `immediate_termination` to be `True` by default for safer function calling.

### Changelog v0.0.2:
- Fixed function returns.
- Added error handling to `CodeSafe`, removed some print statements with edits from `@0XC7R`.

### Changelog v0.0.1:
- Initial release

## Installation

You can install CodeSafe using pip:

```bash
pip install codesafe
```

## Supported Python Versions

CodeSafe supports the following Python versions:

- Python 3.6
- Python 3.7
- Python 3.8
- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11/Later (Preferred)

Please ensure that you have one of these Python versions installed before using CodeSafe. CodeSafe may not work as expected on lower versions of Python than the supported.

## Features

- **Safe Eval**: Safely allow `eval()` expressions to run, while maintaining complete control over the entire evaluation process.
- **Code Encryption/Decryption**: Quickly encrypt your code. This is meant for code obfuscation, and not high-level encryption.
- **Run encrypted code at runtime**: Run your encrypted code files, without needing to expose your code to end-users.

> [!NOTE]
> Running encrypted files at runtime using `run()` are only available in formats that can be understood by Python.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running `safe_eval`, make sure to wait for the Python file to finish its bootstrapping phase. This can be done by simply waiting for:
> ```python
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>    # Run eval, etc.
> ```
> If you're planning on including `safe_eval` in executables:
> ```python
> import multiprocessing
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>       multiprocessing.freeze_support()
>       # Call safe_eval afterwards
> ```
> You can read more about why this needs to be done here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/windows.html#multiprocessing-error-without-if-clause-protection

## Usage

### Safe Eval

```python
from codesafe import safe_eval

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run a normal, safe expression
    expression = "1 + 1"
    disallowed_expression = "os.getcwd()"

    result1 = safe_eval(expression, timeout=10, immediate_termination=True)
    result2 = safe_eval(disallowed_expression, timeout=10, immediate_termination=True)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Attribute inspection is disabled when using `safe_eval`. You can read more about how to use `safe_eval` from [here](https://infinitode-docs.gitbook.io/documentation/package-documentation/codesafe-package-documentation).

### Encrypt & Run Code

```python
from codesafe import encrypt_to_file, decrypt_to_file, run

code = """
greetJohnny = "Hello Johnny!"

def greet_someone(greeting):
    print(greeting)

greet_someone(greetJohnny)
"""

# Encrypt the code
encrypted_file_path = "encrypted_code.encrypt"
encrypt_to_file(code, encrypted_file_path)

# Run the encrypted code
run(encrypted_file_path) # Hello Johnny!

# Decrypt code to another file
output_file = "decrypted_code.py"
decrypt_to_file(encrypted_file_path, output_file)
```
