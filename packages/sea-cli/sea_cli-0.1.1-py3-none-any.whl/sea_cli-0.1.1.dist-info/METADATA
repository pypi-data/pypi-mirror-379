# SEA CLI: Structured Entropy Analysis Command-Line Utility

## Overview

The `sea-cli` is a command-line utility designed to perform Structured Entropy Analysis (SEA). It processes data from various molecular dynamics simulations and analysis files, providing a streamlined way to perform complex calculations directly from your terminal. The utility is configured via a simple YAML file, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows.

## Features

- **Simple Interface:** A clean and intuitive command-line interface powered by `click`.

- **Configuration-Driven:** All inputs and parameters are managed through a single YAML configuration file, ensuring reproducibility and easy sharing of settings.

- **Flexible Inputs:** Supports multiple input files, including `rmsd.txt`, `rg.txt`, and `rmsf.txt`.

- **Structured Output:** Generates processed data into a specified export folder, with a clear output format.

## Installation

The `sea-cli` can be easily installed from PyPI using `pip`.

```bash
    pip install sea-cli
```

## Usage

The primary command to run the analysis is `sea run`. You must provide the path to your configuration file using the `--config` or `-c` option.

```bash
    sea run --config /path/to/your/config.yaml
```

If you need to see all available options, you can use the built-in help command:

```bash
    sea --help
    sea run --help
```

## Configuration File (`config.yaml`)

The `sea-cli` is configured using a YAML file. The file must contain a top-level `config` key with the following structure. Pay close attention to the indentation, as it is critical in YAML.

```bash
    input:
      rmsd: rmsd.txt
      rg: rg.txt
      rmsf: rmsf.txt
    bits: 8
    export_folder: Exported_Data
```

- `input`: A nested dictionary specifying the paths to your input data files. All files listed are relative to the directory where the command is executed.

- `bits`: An integer value used for the analysis.

- `export_folder`: The name of the folder where the processed data will be saved.
