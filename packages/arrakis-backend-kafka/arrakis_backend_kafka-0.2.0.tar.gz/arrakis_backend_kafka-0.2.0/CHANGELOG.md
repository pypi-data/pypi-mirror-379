# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-26

### Added

- Add gaps for missing channels from stream endpoint
- Set timeout in muxer based on maximum latency across channels

### Fixed

- Fix issue with partition endpoint skipping partitioning channels
- Properly handle start/end arguments in stream endpoint:
  * Raises errors when start time contains data that is not available
  * End time being set acts as an termination condition for the stream
- Fix issue where Kafka consumer hangs on assignment when assigning offsets

### Changed

- Do not assign start time if not specified for stream endpoint
- Assign random group IDs for Kafka consumer to avoid sharing consumer offsets
- Switch from appdirs to platformdirs for user cache directory, where metadata
  is stored
- Improve performance for many concurrent clients:
  * Switch to direct compute record batch filtering to reduce overhead
  * Force pyarrow operations to be single-threaded to reduce thread pool contention
  * Extract single time from batch instead of converting to numpy first
  * Optimize arrow IPC stream reader creation/destruction overhead
  * Use a global memory pool for Arrow operations, prioritizing high-performance
    allocators optimized for concurrent workloads
- Increase minimum arrakis-server version to 0.4
- Ignore dropped data going into muxer rather than produce a warning message,
  as this can cause a cascading failure due to logging message overhead
