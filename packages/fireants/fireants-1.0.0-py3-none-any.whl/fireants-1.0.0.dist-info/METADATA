# :fire: FireANTs: Adaptive Riemannian Optimization for Multi-Scale Diffeomorphic Registration

The FireANTs library is a lightweight registration package for Riemannian diffeomorphic registration on GPUs.

## Installation 
To use the FireANTs package, you can either 

- Use Docker (see [docker/README.md](docker/README.md), _highly recommended_)
- Clone the repository and install the package locally
- Install the package directly from PyPI.

If you do not want to use Docker, we recommend using a fresh Anaconda/Miniconda environment to install the package.
```
conda create -n fireants python=3.9
```

To install FireANTs locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/rohitrango/fireants
cd fireants
pip install .
pip install ./fused_ops
```

By default, doing `pip install .` will **NOT** include the fused CUDA operations. 
I highly recommend installing the fused CUDA operations using `pip install ./fused_ops`.

Or install from PyPI:
```
pip install fireants
pip install fireants_fused_ops
```

## Tutorial
To check out some of the tutorials, check out the `tutorials/` directory for usage.
Alternatively, to reproduce the results in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01249) checkout the `fireants/scripts/` directory.


## Documentation
You can also check out the [Documentation](https://fireants.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Feel free to reach out to me for improvements in the documentation.

## Datasets
In the paper, we use the datasets as following: 
* Klein's evaluation of 14 non-linear registration algorithms: [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3251018)
* EMPIRE10 lung registration challenge: [here](https://empire10.grand-challenge.org/)
* Expansion Microscopy dataset: [here](https://rnr-exm.grand-challenge.org/)

## Contributing
Feel free to [add issues](https://github.com/rohitrango/fireants/issues/new) or [pull requests](https://github.com/rohitrango/fireants/compare) to the repository. We welcome contributions to the package.

## Tests

To run the tests, run the following command:
```bash
bash run_tests.sh
```
Feel free to report any issues with the tests to the [issues](https://github.com/rohitrango/fireants/issues/new) page.
