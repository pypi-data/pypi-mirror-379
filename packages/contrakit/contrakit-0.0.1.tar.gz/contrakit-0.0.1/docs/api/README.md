# Contrakit API Reference

**A Python library for mathematical modeling of observational contradictions and multi-perspective analysis.**

This API reference provides detailed documentation for each module in the `contrakit` library, including usage patterns, architecture notes, and entry points for both casual users and advanced integrators.

## Quick Start

```python
from contrakit import Observatory

# Create a simple observational system
obs = Observatory.create(symbols=["Yes", "No"])
voter = obs.concept("Voter")
obs.perspectives[voter] = {"Yes": 0.6, "No": 0.4}
behavior = obs.perspectives.to_behavior()
print(f"Agreement: {behavior.agreement_score():.3f}")
```

## How to Navigate This API

Not sure where to begin? Start with [`observatory.py`](observatory.md)â€”it wraps core components in a more intuitive interface. Power users can work directly with lower-level modules following the dependency chain below.

## Core Modules

## `space.py` â€“ Defining what can be measured
Foundation for observable spaces and measurement schemas. Defines observables, alphabets, and provides algebraic operations for composing/restricting spaces.

## `distribution.py` â€“ Immutable probability containers
Core data structure for probability mass functions. Optimized for constant-time lookups, safe convex operations, and includes validation/mixing metrics.

## `context.py` â€“ Measurement contexts & relationships
Defines subsets of observables measured together. Provides set operations and assignment restriction algorithms for different experimental setups.

## `behavior.py` â€“ Multi-perspective analysis
Represents collections of probability distributions across contexts. Analyzes consistency, detects contradictions, and quantifies information cost.

## `convex_models.py` â€“ Optimization solvers
High-level convex optimization programs using CVXPY. Computes agreement coefficients and finds optimal global distributions for contradiction analysis.

## ðŸ”­ `observatory.py` â€“ High-level fluent API
User-friendly interface for constructing behaviors. Provides fluent methods for defining concepts, assigning distributions, and includes lens system for viewpoint modeling.
