**TAU** is a high-performance Python package for modularity-based community detection using a hybrid of genetic algorithms and graph clustering methods (Louvain and Leiden). It is built for scalability, parallelism, and usability across research and applied machine learning settings.

---

## Features

- **Genetic Initialization**: Enhances clustering quality by optimizing initial conditions with evolutionary search.
- **Pluggable Clustering Engines**: Supports Louvain and Leiden algorithms.
- **Parallel Execution**: Uses Python's multiprocessing/threading for speed-up across CPUs.
- **Flexible Graph Input**: Read from adjacency lists, edge lists, CSVs, or pandas DataFrames.
- **CLI and API Access**: Run from the terminal or call programmatically in Python.
- **Reproducible Runs**: Optional random seed parameter for repeatable experiments.

|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `--graph`          | Path to graph file (adjacency list, edge list, etc.) | **Required**        |
| `--size`           | Population size for genetic algorithm                | 60                  |
| `--workers`        | Number of parallel workers                           | All available cores |
| `--max_generations`| Maximum number of generations                        | 500                 |
| `--seed`           | Random seed (optional)                               | None                |

## Python API Example

```python
from community_TAU import community_TAU
import networkx as nx

G = nx.read_edgelist("example.graph")
result = community_TAU(G, size=100, workers=8, max_generations=400)

# Access results
print(result.partition)
print(result.modularity)
```

---

## Input Formats Supported

- Adjacency list (`.graph`)
- Edge list (`.csv`, `.txt`)
- Adjacency matrix (CSV or DataFrame)

Conversion tools are available in the `graph_loader` module.

---

## Output

- Final partition (dictionary of node â†’ community)
- Final modularity score
- Optional generation logs and fitness history

---

## Testing

To run unit tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Test coverage includes input parsing, genetic algorithm logic, clustering evaluation, and parallel execution.
