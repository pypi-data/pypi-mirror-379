# Py++ Python

This library is useful to install when working on a [Py++](https://pypp-docs.readthedocs.io/) project.

It is not required to be able to transpile Py++ code to C++. However, if you want to be able to run your Py++ code with the Python interpreter or have a better IDE experience, this library is needed.

Bug reports and feature requests should be submitted to the Py++ project, and not on this github page.
