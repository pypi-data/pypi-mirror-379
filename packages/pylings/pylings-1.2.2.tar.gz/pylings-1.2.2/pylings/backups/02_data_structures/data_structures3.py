"""
In this exercise, we are going to introduce the concept of dictionaries.

In Python, a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs:

- A dictionary is defined using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons `:`.

- Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).

- Values can be of any data type and can be duplicated.

- Dictionaries allow fast access to values when you know the key.
