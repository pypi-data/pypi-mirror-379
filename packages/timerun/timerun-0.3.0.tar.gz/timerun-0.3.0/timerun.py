# The Timer class needs to store captured durations in a flexible way that    #
# allows users to provide their own storage implementations.                  #
#                                                                             #
# Instead of restricting to specific types like List or Deque, timerun uses a #
# protocol to define the required interface for duration storage.             #
#                                                                             #
# This allows users to provide custom storage backends (database, file,       #
# memory-mapped, etc.) as long as they implement the basic sequence methods.  #
