    ----------
    channels : list[Channel]
        List of channels for which to determine partition IDs
    publisher: str
        A publisher ID to apply to all channels being partitioned.
        This will override any publisher already specified in the
        channel metadata returned.
    metadata: dict[str, Channel]
        An existing channel metadata dictionary, from which existing
        partition information will be taken.
    max_channels: int
        The maximum number per partition.
    partition_fraction: float
        Fraction of max channels to use in intial partition
        allocation.
