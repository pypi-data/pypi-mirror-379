# water-column-sonar-resampling
Water Column Sonar Data Reprocessing Project for Warren Tech Capstone 2026

## Reminders
If you update the patch number in `pyproject.toml` please make sure to also update the patch number (the last number) in `.python-version`

To get the most fresh copy of the project run `uv venv` and then sun the source command given `source .venv/bin/activate` -- opens a venv with all of the most up to date packages and code.

To add a new package to the enviorment you can install it inside of the venv or use `uv add <package name>` followed by `uv sync` instead.
