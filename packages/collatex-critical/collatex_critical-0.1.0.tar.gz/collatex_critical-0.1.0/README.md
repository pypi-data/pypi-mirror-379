**collatex-critical** helps scholars prepare critical editions from multiple textual witnesses, producing outputs suitable for publication.

Unlike `python-collatex`, which focuses on column-based difference visualization in XML, SVG, or HTML, `collatex-critical` produces **Markdown, PDF, HTML, and LaTeX** outputs where the **majority reading appears in the main text**, and variant readings are recorded in **footnotes or endnotes**.

---

## Features

* Multi-witness collation with clear footnote apparatus
* Output in **Markdown, PDF, HTML, and LaTeX**
* Supports multiple transliteration schemes: Devanagari, IAST, SLP1
* Integrates seamlessly with [CollateX](https://collatex.net/)
* Designed specifically for **critical editions and scholarly texts**

## Setting Up a Project

1. Place witness texts in `input/projectName/devanagari`.
2. Name witness files according to precedence:

   * Less than 10 witnesses: `1.txt`, `2.txt`, `3.txt` …
   * 10 or more witnesses: `01.txt`, `02.txt`, `03.txt` …
3. **File order indicates descending precedence** (first file = highest authority).

---

## Running the Project

```bash
sh generate.sh projectName
```

* Creates missing directories under `input/` and `output/`.
* Generates outputs in all available transliteration schemes.
* Input witness files must exist prior to running.

---

## Output

For each project:

* `projectName.md`, `projectName.pdf`, `projectName.tex`, `projectName.html`
  → `output/projectName/devanagari/`

* Corresponding outputs in other transliterations:
  → `output/projectName/iast/` and `output/projectName/slp1/`

---

## Collation Logic

1. **Majority Rule:** Reading preferred by the majority appears in the main text; others appear in footnotes.
2. **Tie-Breaker:** If no clear majority, the order of precedence determines the main reading (`01.txt` > `02.txt` > …).

> The choice of the most faithful witness is left to the editor’s discretion (e.g., oldest, most accurate, or scholarly judgment).
