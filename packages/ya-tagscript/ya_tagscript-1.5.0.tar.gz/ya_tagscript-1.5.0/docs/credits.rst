A massive thanks to everyone who paved the way with their previous incarnations of
TagScript!

- JonSnowbd_ for their `original TagScript <JonSnowbd_repo_>`_ and all its
  `contributors <JonSnowbd_contributors_>`_
- phenom4n4n_ for their `TagScript fork <phenom4n4n_repo_>`_ and all its
  `contributors <phenom4n4n_contributors_>`_
- benz206_ for their `bTagScript <benz206_repo_>`_ and all its
  `contributors <benz206_contributors_>`_


Specific credits for copied/adapted blocks can be found in the source files of the
relevant blocks. Most are not direct copies but instead more or less heavily adapted
versions that have their roots in the credited version. Credited blocks use a permalink
to the commit version at which I took (inspiration from) them.

- phenom4n4n_ for most of the pre-existing blocks

    - These are not specially credited since this entire project is a fork of their
      version

- benz206_ specifically for the following blocks:

    - :class:`~ya_tagscript.blocks.DeleteBlock`
    - :class:`~ya_tagscript.blocks.ReactBlock`
    - :class:`~ya_tagscript.blocks.OrdinalBlock`
    - :class:`~ya_tagscript.blocks.CommentBlock`
    - :class:`~ya_tagscript.blocks.DebugBlock`
    - :class:`~ya_tagscript.blocks.RandomBlock`'s weighting logic
