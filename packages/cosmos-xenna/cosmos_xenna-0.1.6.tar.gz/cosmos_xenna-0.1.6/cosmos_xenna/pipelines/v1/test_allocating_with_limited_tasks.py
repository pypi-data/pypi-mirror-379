"""
Simple example which shows the poor allocation when there are limited tasks.

The issue is that when there are limited tasks, and when actors take longer to set up than other actors,
the actor pool will allocate multiple tasks to the already-setup actors, and then will run out of tasks
for new actors.

As a result, actors will be idle even through there is work to do.

Maybe we should do some sort of work-stealing?
