    This class serves as a foundation for building stages in yotta pipelines.
    Each stage can perform specific data transformations, with flexible resource allocation for GPU or CPU processing.

    Resource Allocation Rules:
    - Exactly one of num_gpus_per_worker or num_cpus_per_worker must be non-None
    - GPU stages automatically get allocated 1 CPU in addition to their GPU allocation
    - Both GPU and CPU allocations can be fractional (e.g., 0.5 GPU or 0.5 CPU)
    - For fractional GPU allocations, multiple workers can share the same GPU

    Worker Assignment Behavior:
    - CPU workers: Assignment is only relevant at the node level. Workers assigned to different CPUs
      on the same node functionally behave the same way
    - GPU workers: Ray manages CUDA environment variables to ensure each worker only sees its
      assigned GPU(s). For CPU-only stages, CUDA variables will point to no GPUs

    Environment Management:
    - Each stage can run in a separate conda environment
    - The environment can be specified either by:
      1. Implementing the conda_env_name property
      2. Using the environment specified by the model (if a model is set)

    See README.md for more information.

        Return a ray_utils.Resources object which represents the size/hape of each worker in this stage.
        If None, inherit from the model's required resources.

        This `Resources` class provides an intuitive interface for specifying resource requirements
        that get translated into more detailed internal worker shapes. Here's how the
        resource specifications map to different worker shapes and their allocation
        behaviors:

        1. CPU-Only Shape:
            - Set cpus > 0
            - Leave gpus = 0
            Example: Resources(cpus=2.0)
            Allocation behavior:
                - Only allocated CPU cores, no GPU resources
                - Multiple workers can share the same CPU cores through fractional allocation
                - Never allocated to GPU resources even if available
                - Ray/Yotta does not actually keep track of what particular cores are assigned to particular workers.
                  Instead, for each node, the cpus are treated as a big pool.

        2. Fractional GPU Shape (sharing GPUs):
            - Set gpus to value between 0 and 1 exclusive
            - Optionally set cpus
            Example: Resources(cpus=1.0, gpus=0.5)
            Allocation behavior:
                - Gets allocated fraction of a single GPU's compute capacity
                - Multiple workers can share same GPU up to 100% total utilization

        3. Whole Numbered GPU Shape:
            - Set gpus to integer ≥ 1
            - Optionally set cpus
            Example: Resources(cpus=1.0, gpus=2)
            Allocation behavior:
                - Gets allocated requested number of whole GPUs
                - Each GPU is allocated exclusively (not shared)
                - System optimizes GPU selection to minimize fragmentation

        Resource Allocation Strategy:
        The system uses a fragmentation-aware allocation strategy that:
        - Minimizes resource fragmentation across the cluster
        - Tries to keep related resources (GPU compute) together
        - Prefers allocations that maintain flexibility for future requests
        - Can reuse recently freed allocations to prevent thrashing
        - Balances load across available nodes while respecting constraints
