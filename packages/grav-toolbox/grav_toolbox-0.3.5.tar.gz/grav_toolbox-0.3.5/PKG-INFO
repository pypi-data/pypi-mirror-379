# GravTools
GravTools is an open source software toolbox for the analysis of relative gravity surveys. 
GravTools is developed at Austria's Federal Office of Metrology and Surveying (BEV).  

 - The source code is hosted on github.com: https://github.com/ahellers/GravTools
 - The python package is published on pypi.org: https://pypi.org/project/grav-toolbox/


# Installation

The python 3 package is available on the Python package index website (pypi.org) and can be easily installed using pip.

## Install python package with pip:
`pip install grav-toolbox`

## Optional dependency for GIS data export
GravTools allows users to export adjustment results to shapefiles for data visualization in external GIS programs (e.g. QGIS).
To enable these features the optional package "geopandas" needs to be installed by executing:
`pip install grav-toolbox[gis]`

# Release notes
More details are provided along with version tags on github.

## 0.3.3 (2025-01-08)
  - New dialog for drift determination based on the reduced observations as shown in the observations plot. One drift 
polynomial is fitted per station. This feature is useful for calculating the drift correction coefficient for Scintrex 
CG5 and CG6 meters based on stationary observations. 

## 0.3.4 (2025-02-07)
  - Fixed bug in the data export dialog.

## 0.3.5 (2025-09-24)
  - Fixed bug: The survey name was recognized as instrument S/N when loading CG6 solo observation files.
