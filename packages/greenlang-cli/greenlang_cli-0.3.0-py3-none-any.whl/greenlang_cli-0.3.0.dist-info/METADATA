**Enterprise-grade climate intelligence platform for building, deploying, and managing climate-aware applications. Infrastructure-first with a powerful SDK.**

## What is GreenLang?

GreenLang is the Climate Intelligence Platform that provides managed runtime primitives, governance, and distribution for climate-aware applications. Built infrastructure-first with a comprehensive SDK, GreenLang enables organizations to deploy, manage, and scale climate intelligence across their operations - from smart buildings and HVAC systems to industrial processes and renewable energy optimization.

### Platform Capabilities

**Infrastructure & Runtime:**
- **Managed Runtime**: Deploy packs with versioning, autoscaling, and isolation
- **Policy Governance**: RBAC, capability-based security, and audit logging
- **Pack Registry**: Signed, versioned components with SBOM and dependencies
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Local, Docker, and Kubernetes deployment options
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics, tracing, and performance monitoring

**Developer SDK & Framework:**
- **AI-Powered Agents**: 15+ specialized climate intelligence components
- **Composable Packs**: Modular, reusable building blocks for rapid development
- **YAML Pipelines**: Declarative workflows with conditional logic
- **Type-Safe Python SDK**: 100% typed interfaces with strict validation
- **Global Coverage**: Localized emission factors for 12+ major economies

## Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install greenlang-cli

# With analytics capabilities
pip install greenlang-cli[analytics]

# Full feature set
pip install greenlang-cli[full]

# Development environment
pip install greenlang-cli[dev]
```

## Quick Start

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Initialize a new GreenLang project
gl init my-climate-app

# Create a new pack for emissions calculation
gl pack new building-emissions

# Run emissions analysis
gl calc --building office_complex.json

# Analyze with recommendations
gl analyze results.json --format detailed

# Execute a pipeline
gl pipeline run decarbonization.yaml
```

### Python SDK

```python
from greenlang import GreenLang
from greenlang.models import Building, EmissionFactors
from greenlang.agents import BuildingAgent, HVACOptimizer

# Initialize GreenLang
gl = GreenLang()

# Create a building model
building = Building(
    name="Tech Campus A",
    area_m2=50000,
    location="San Francisco",
    building_type="office"
)

# Calculate emissions
agent = BuildingAgent()
results = agent.calculate_emissions(
    building=building,
    energy_data=energy_consumption,
    emission_factors=EmissionFactors.get_region("US-CA")
)

# Get optimization recommendations
optimizer = HVACOptimizer()
recommendations = optimizer.optimize(
    building=building,
    current_emissions=results.total_emissions,
    target_reduction=0.30  # 30% reduction target
)

print(f"Current emissions: {results.total_emissions} tCO2e/year")
print(f"Potential savings: ${recommendations.estimated_savings:,.2f}")
```

### YAML Pipelines

      max_payback_years: 5

  - name: reporting
    type: output
    format: pdf
    template: executive_summary
```

## Core Concepts

### Packs
Modular, reusable components that encapsulate climate intelligence logic:
- **Calculation Packs**: Emissions calculations for specific industries
- **Optimization Packs**: Decarbonization strategies and recommendations
- **Integration Packs**: Connect to external data sources and APIs
- **Reporting Packs**: Generate customized sustainability reports

### Agents
AI-powered components that provide intelligent climate analysis:
- **BuildingAgent**: Comprehensive building emissions analysis
- **HVACOptimizer**: HVAC system optimization recommendations
- **SolarThermalAgent**: Solar thermal replacement calculations
- **PolicyAgent**: Climate policy compliance checking
- **BenchmarkAgent**: Industry and regional benchmarking

### Pipelines
Orchestrate complex climate intelligence workflows:
- Chain multiple agents and packs together
- Define conditional logic and branching
- Integrate with external systems
- Schedule recurring analyses
- Generate automated reports

## Real-World Applications

### Smart Buildings
- Real-time emissions monitoring and alerting
- Predictive maintenance for HVAC systems
- Occupancy-based energy optimization
- Automated sustainability reporting

### Industrial Decarbonization
- Process emissions calculation
- Energy efficiency recommendations
- Alternative fuel analysis
