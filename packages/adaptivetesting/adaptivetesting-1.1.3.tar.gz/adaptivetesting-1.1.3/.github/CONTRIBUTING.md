# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

- All pull requests **must** be opened against the `dev` branch.
- Ensure your code passes all test workflows:
    - `mypy` (type checking)
    - `flake8` (linting)
    - Unit tests

Pull requests that meet these requirements will be considered for merging.
