@public change log
==================

6.0.2 (2025-09-24)
==================
* Documentation improvements.
* Temporary `workaround <https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo/issues/889#issuecomment-3291032986>`__ for a furo
  theme bug in dark mode.
* CI updates.

6.0.1 (2025-05-06)
==================
* Fix test suite when run with Python < 3.12.  (:GL:`28`)
* Add test for Python 3.14.

6.0 (2025-05-06)
================
* Added ``populate_all()`` which can be called from the bottom of your module to infer and populate your
  module's ``__all__``.  Use this if you don't like the decorator syntax.  (:GL:`27`)
* Documentation improvements.

5.1 (2025-01-23)
================
* Drop official support for Python 3.8, add support for Python 3.13.

5.0 (2024-07-24)
================
* ``@public`` is now properly type annotated.
* Adopt ``hatch test`` and ``hatch fmt`` commands. (:GL:`25`)
* ``@public`` and ``@private`` now raise ``TypeError`` instead of
  ``ValueError`` if ``__all__`` is not a concrete ``list`` object. (:GL:`26`)
* Other minor coding improvements identified by ``ruff``.
* Switch to `Trusted Publishing
  <https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/#gitlab-cicd>`_
  for publishing new versions to PyPI.  (:GL:`24`)

4.1 (2024-03-29)
================
* Add support for Python 3.12. (:GL:`22`)
* Switch to ``hatch``, replacing ``pdm`` and ``tox``. (:GL:`21`)

4.0 (2023-06-05)
================
* Drop Python 3.7 support. (:GL:`16`)
* Remove ``public.install()`` which was used to inject the ``public`` and
  ``private`` functions into the ``builtins`` namespace.  This isn't very
  helpful and could be actively harmful.  Explicit is better than
  implicit. (:GL:`14`)
* The functional form of ``public()`` now returns the argument *values* in the
  order they are given.  This allows you to explicitly bind those values to
  names in the global namespace.  While this is redundant, it does solve some
  linter problems.  (:GL:`12`)
* Switch from ``flake8`` and ``isort`` to ``ruff`` for code quality. (:GL:`32`)
* Bump dependencies.

3.1.2 (2023-05-31)
==================
* Switch to ``pdm-backend`` (:GL:`15`)
* Bump dependencies.
* More GitLab CI integration improvements.

  and ``setup.cfg``.
* Build the docs with Python 3.8.

* Adopt the `Furo <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/>`_ documentation theme.
* Use `importlib.metadata.version()
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html#distribution-versions>`_
  as a better way to get the package version number for the documentation.
* Drop Python 3.6 support.
* Update Windows GitLab runner to include Python 3.10.
* Update copyright years.

================
* Do type hinting the right way. (:GL:`10`)

2.2 (2021-04-13)
================

* Reorganized docs and tests out of the code directory (:GL:`7`).

2.0 (2020-07-27)
================
