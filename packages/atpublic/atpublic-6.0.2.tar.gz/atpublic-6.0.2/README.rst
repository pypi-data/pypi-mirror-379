======================
 @public and @private
======================

This library provides two very simple decorators that document the public visibility of the names in
your module.  They keep your module's ``__all__`` in sync so you don't have to.

Also included is a function that you can put at the bottom of your module to simply infer all the public
names, and populate the ``__all__`` for you.
