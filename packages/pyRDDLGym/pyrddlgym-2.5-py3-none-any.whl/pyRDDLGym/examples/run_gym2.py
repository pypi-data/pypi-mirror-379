'''In this example, a random policy is constructed and its performance is
evaluated on a specified domain. 

The syntax for running this example is:

    python run_gym2.py <domain> <instance> [<episodes>] [<seed>]
    
where:
    <domain> is the name of a domain located in the /Examples directory
    <instance> is the instance number
    <episodes> is a positive integer for the number of episodes to simulate
    (defaults to 1)
    <seed> is a positive integer RNG key (defaults to 42)
