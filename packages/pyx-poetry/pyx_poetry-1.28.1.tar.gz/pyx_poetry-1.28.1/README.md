# PyXMake
> This subpackage belongs to [PyXMake](https://gitlab.com/dlr-sy/pyxmake) and distributes an application plugin for [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as an optional dependency. It can be installed together with the parent project. However, it is also separately available to ensure backwards compatibility. Please refer to the linked [repository](https://gitlab.com/dlr-sy/pyxmake) for documentation and application examples.
