## [3.3.0] -- 2025-02-14

### Added

* CHANGELOG.md
* LICENSE

### Changed

* Transcription.py: Conteneur and Tier class: Parents are
automatically set for all Segments of a new, copied Tier.
* toElan: ID of Segments are by default renamed. Using
`rename_segs=False` avoids this.
* Updating README including new information.

### Fixed

* Improved fromElan importing .eaf files.
* Transcription.py: Conteneur class: Having a deepcopy of metadata
instead of a shallow copy. This fixed the issue, where fromElan
would overwrite metadata for a new, copied Tier object.
