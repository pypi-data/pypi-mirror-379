This log file should be accessible in the UI which would then have a \"save\" option for the user to record this if they want to. Note it is not clearly exactly what workflows require this so it's somewhat \"nice-to-have\", and probably also needs a start/stop option (or at least a way to clear and then save only what came after clearing)."
