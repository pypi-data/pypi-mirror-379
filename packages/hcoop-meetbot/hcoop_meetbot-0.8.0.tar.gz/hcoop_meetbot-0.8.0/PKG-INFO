[hcoop-meetbot](https://github.com/pronovic/hcoop-meetbot) is a plugin for [Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria), a bot framework for IRC.  It is designed to help run meetings on IRC.  It was originally written for quarterly board meetings at [HCoop](https://hcoop.net), when Ken was on the board there.

The code is based in part on the [MeetBot](https://github.com/rkdarst/MeetBot/) plugin for Supybot written by Richard Darst. Supybot is the predecessor to Limnoria.  Richard's MeetBot was "inspired by the original MeetBot, by Holger Levsen, which was itself a deri vative of Mootbot by the Ubuntu Scribes team".  So, this code has a relatively long history.  For this version, much of the plugin was rewritten using Python 3, but it generally follows the pattern set by Richard's original code.  

See the [user documentation](https://hcoop-meetbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more information about how to use the plugin, including installation instructions.
