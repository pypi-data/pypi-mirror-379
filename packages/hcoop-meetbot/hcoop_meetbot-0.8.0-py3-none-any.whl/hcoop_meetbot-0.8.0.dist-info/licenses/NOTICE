The source code is based in part on the MeetBot plugin for Supybot written by
Richard Darst:

   https://github.com/rkdarst/MeetBot/

Basically all of the original code was rewritten using Python 3, and the
structure and interface are not compatible.  However, the new implementation
generally follows the pattern set by Richard's original code, and it tries
to stay compatible where possible.

The original MeetBot source code was released under the following license:
