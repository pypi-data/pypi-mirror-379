## Overview
This repository contains a Python package designed for modular and efficient text processing workflows. Currently, it includes the following subpackages:

- **Language Identification Pipeline**: Identifies the language of input text and returns a probability score.
- **OCR QA Pipeline**: Assesses the quality of OCR text by estimating the proportion of recognized words (0–1), using efficient language-specific Bloom filters.
- **LDA Topic Modeling Pipeline**: Soft clustering of input texts using LDA-based topic modeling. 
- **News Agencies Pipeline**: Extracts and ranks news agency entities from text, providing relevance scores and optional links to Wikidata.
- **Lucene/Solr normalization Pipeline**: Replicates Solr’s language-specific text normalization to clarify how input text is tokenized and indexed in impresso.


## Installation
To install the full package with all submodules:
```bash
pip install "impresso-pipelines[all]"
```
The `[all]` extra installs all dependencies required for each component.


To install individual modules without unnecessary dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install "impresso-pipelines[langident]"         # Language Identification
pip install "impresso-pipelines[ocrqa]"             # OCR QA
pip install "impresso-pipelines[ldatopics]"         # LDA Topics
pip install "impresso-pipelines[newsagencies]"      # News Agencies
pip install "impresso-pipelines[solrnormalization]" # Solr text normalization
```

## Usage
Each pipeline is instantiated from a corresponding class. 
```python
from impresso_pipelines.langident import LangIdentPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.ocrqa import OCRQAPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.ldatopics import LDATopicsPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.newsagencies import NewsAgenciesPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.solrnormalization import SolrNormalizationPipeline
```

## Pipeline Examples

## Future Plans
Additional functionality will be added to extend use cases and support further processing tasks.
