## Caveats

### No Scheduled Orders

If there are no scheduled orders (sales orders, purchase orders, or build orders) for a part, the plugin will not be able to generate a forecast. In this case, the stock forecasting information will not be displayed.

### Insufficient Information

In some cases there may be insufficient information to generate a full stock forecast. This may be because the open orders to not have associated target dates, or becaused the scheduled order dates are in the past. In this case, the plugin will display a warning message indicating that the forecast chart cannot be generated:
