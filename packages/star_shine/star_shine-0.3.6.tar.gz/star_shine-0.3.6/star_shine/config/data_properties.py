    Notes
    -----
    The principle exploited by Koen (2006) is that the real Nyquist frequency of a time series with uneven sampling,
    where the sampling is also not a simple multiple of some small value, is a multiple of the simple approximation
    of the Nyquist frequency:
    f = 1 / (2 * delta_t_min)
    Since this function is computationally intensive, it is recommended to simply pick a multiple of the
    simple approximation in case a higher value is desired.
