    Parameters
    ----------
    time: numpy.ndarray[Any, dtype[float]]
        Timestamps of the time series
    flux: numpy.ndarray[Any, dtype[float]]
        Measurement values of the time series
    f0: float
        Starting frequency of the periodogram.
        If left zero, default is f0 = 1/(100*T)
    fn: float
        Last frequency of the periodogram.
        If left zero, default is fn = 1/(2*np.min(np.diff(time))) = Nyquist frequency
    df: float
        Frequency sampling space of the periodogram
        If left zero, default is df = 1/(10*T) = oversampling factor of ten (recommended)
    norm: str
        Normalisation of the periodogram. Choose from:
        'amplitude', 'density' or 'distribution'

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing the following elements:
        f1: numpy.ndarray[Any, dtype[float]]
            Frequencies at which the periodogram was calculated
        s1: numpy.ndarray[Any, dtype[float]]
            The periodogram spectrum in the chosen units

    Notes
    -----
    Approximation using fft, much faster (in mode='fast') than the single threaded scargle (about x10).
    Note that the astropy implementation uses functions under the hood that use the blas package for
    multithreading by default. Compared to the parallel scargle it is similar in speed.
    Beware of computing narrower frequency windows, as there is inconsistency when doing this.
    It is also generally less accurate.
