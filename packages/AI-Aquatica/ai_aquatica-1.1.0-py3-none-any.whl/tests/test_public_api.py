"""Tests for the top-level public API re-exports.

These checks focus on a small representative subset of the package's
``__all__`` to ensure that the documented entry points remain importable
and callable without executing the heavy downstream dependencies.  Costly
I/O or plotting backends are mocked so that the test remains lightweight.
