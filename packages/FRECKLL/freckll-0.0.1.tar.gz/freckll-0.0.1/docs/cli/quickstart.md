# CLI Quickstart

This is a quick look at how to use the command line program (CLI). For more detailed information, please refer to the [CLI](cli.md) and [Input File](inputfile.md) documentation.

Lets first look at the command line options. You can see them by running:

```bash
$ freckll --help
```

This will show you the available options and their descriptions. The most important options are `-o` or `--output` which describe where to store the results in [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org) format.

## Running your first input file

Lets run a reduced chemical scheme. First we can find some inputs under the `examples/input` directory. Lets first `cd` into the directory:

```bash
$ cd examples/input
```

Now we will run a reduced chemical scheme. Lets run `hd209458_reduced.yml`, we will store the results in `hd209458_reduced.h5`. The command is:

```bash
$ freckll hd209458_reduced.yml -o hd209458_reduced.h5
```

Hopefully this should complete within a few seconds! If we check the directory, we should see the output file:

```bash
$ ls
hd209458_reduced.h5
```

If you want to see the results using Python you can refer to the [Storing and Reading Results](../gettingstarted.md#storing-and-reading-results) documentation, however we
can also ask `freckll` to generate a plot for us when we run the command. This is done using the `--plot` option. Since we plan to run other networks, we can add a prefix to our plots by using the `--plot-prefix` option. This will add the prefix to the plot name. The command is:

```bash
$ freckll hd209458_reduced.yml -o hd209458_reduced.h5 --plot --plot-prefix reduced --overwrite
```

(_Note: We need to use the `--overwrite` command to force FRECKLL to overwrite your previous result file, you can omit it if the result file has been deleted._)

This will generate the same result file `hd209458_reduced.h5` as well as plot labelled `reduced_solution.png`:

![reduced_solution.png](quickstart/reduced_solution.png)

This is a quick overview of the system, with the top-left representing your $T$-$P$ and $K_{zz}$ profiles, top-right representing the initial and final abundances of the species, the bottom-left representing the initial and final mean molecular weight ($\mu$) and bottom-right representing the actinic flux used (if photochemistry is enabled). We can also go one step further and generate an animation of the results evolving over time. This is done using the `--animate` option. The command is:

```bash
$ freckll hd209458_reduced.yml -o hd209458_reduced.h5 --plot --plot-prefix reduced --animate --overwrite
```

This will generate the same result file `hd209458_reduced.h5` as well as video labelled `reduced_animation.mp4`:

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    <source src="reduced_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>

## Finishing the solve.

You may have noticed that the simulation never quite reached steady state. Lets fix that by increasing the time span from $10^{4}$ to something like $10^{11}$ to give the system more time to evolve. We can do this by editing the input file `hd209458_reduced.yml`. The relevant section is:

```yaml
solver:
  method: rosenbrock
  t_span: [0.0, 4e4]
```

We can change the `t_span` to `[0.0, 1e11]` and save the file. Now we can run the command again, this time changing the prefix to `reduced_ss` (**Reduced** **S**teady **S**tate). The command is:

```bash
$ freckll hd209458_reduced.yml -o hd209458_reduced.h5 --plot --plot-prefix reduced_ss --animate --overwrite
```

This will generate the same result file `hd209458_reduced.h5` as well as plots and video labelled `reduced_ss_animation.mp4`:

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    <source src="reduced_ss_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>

Nice! We can see we have reached steady state. However we never reached $10^{11}$. This is because FRECKLL uses two other criteria to determine steady state.:

$$
\Delta X < \epsilon_x
$$

and

$$
\frac{\Delta X}{\Delta t} < \epsilon_t
$$

Where $\delta X$ is the change in abundance between timsteps, $\delta t$ is the change in time between timesteps and $\epsilon$ is a user defined tolerances.
The default values are: $\epsilon_x = 10^{-3}$ and $\epsilon_t = 10^{-8}$. You can change these values in the input file under the `solver` section. The relevant section is:

```yaml
dn_crit: 1e-3
dndt_crit: 1e-8
```

If you want to evolve fully, you can set these to $0$.

## Changing the vertical mixing

Lets now modify the vertical mixing profile and see what happens. This is simply done by changing the $K_{zz}$ profile in the input file. Lets work on the `hd209458_reduced.yml` file again. We can make a copy of the file and call it `hd209458_reduced_high_kzz.yml`. Now we can replace the profile with a new one. The relevant section is:

```yaml
atmosphere:
  tp_profile:
    format: from-file
    filename: tpprofile.csv
    temperature_column: 1
    pressure_column: 0
    comments: "#"
    temperature_unit: K
    pressure_unit: mbar

  kzz:
    format: from-file
    filename: kzz.csv
    kzz_column: 1
    pressure_column: 0
    comments: "#"
    kzz_unit: cm2/s
    pressure_unit: mbar
```

We can replace `kzz` with just a constant instead.

```yaml
kzz: 1e14 cm2/s
```

It is important to note that you must include the units in the input file. The units we've used here are cm$^{2}$/s. Now we can run the command again, this time changing the prefix to `reduced_high_kzz`. The command is:

```bash
$ freckll hd209458_reduced_high_kzz.yml -o hd209458_reduced_high_kzz.h5 --plot --plot-prefix reduced_high_kzz --animate
```

We should see the results in the output file `hd209458_reduced_high_kzz.h5` as well as plots and video labelled `reduced_high_kzz_solution.png` and `reduced_high_kzz_animation.mp4` respectively:
![reduced_high_kzz_solution.png](quickstart/reduced_high_kzz_solution.png)

Here vertical mixing is much more dominant resulting in a much more constant profile. The video is shown below:

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    <source src="reduced_high_kzz_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>

Try changing the value of $K_{zz}$ to something small. Do you see the difference? How about $K_{zz} = 0~\frac{cm}{s^2}$, what do you expect to see?

## Running the full chemical scheme

Now we can go ahead and try to run the full chemical scheme! Lets make a copy of the `hd209458_reduced.yml` file and call it `hd209458_full_scheme.yml`. We can then change the `network` section to:

```yaml
network: venot-methanol-2020
```

Additionally lets solve until $10^{11}$ again. The relevant section is:

```yaml
solver:
  method: rosenbrock
  t_span: [0.0, 1e11]
```

Notice the removal of `reduced`. This will run the full chemical scheme. We will use the original $K_{zz}$ profile provided in the input file. The command is:

```bash
$ freckll hd209458_full_scheme.yml -o hd209458_full_scheme.h5 --plot --plot-prefix full_scheme --animate
```

Now it will take a bit longer to run as we are dealing with a factor of 5x more reactions and 2x more species. This will generate the result file `hd209458_full_scheme.h5` as well as plots and video labelled `full_scheme_solution.png` and `full_scheme_animation.mp4` respectively:
![full_scheme_solution.png](quickstart/full_scheme_solution.png)

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    <source src="full_scheme_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>
Nice! Its similar to the reduced with some difference in the upper atmosphere.

## Adding photochemistry

Finally we can add in photochemistry. First we need to include some flux from the star. FRECKLL has many built in fluxes profiles for stars. We can add in
some stellar flux by adding the following to the input file:

```yaml
star:
  incident_angle: 45 deg
  spectrum: hd209458
```

Where we have defined `spectrum` as one of the built in fluxes. Incident angle is the solar zenith angle. You can also define your own fluxes by using the `from-file` option.

Our stellar spectra is complete! Now we can add in the photochemistry. This is done by adding the following to the input file:

```yaml
photochemistry: venot-methanol-2020-photo
```

Where we have defined `photochemistry` as one of the built in photochemistry schemes.

After that we can run the command again, this time changing the prefix to `full_scheme_photo`. The command is:

```bash
$ freckll hd209458_full_scheme.yml -o hd209458_full_scheme_photo.h5 --plot --plot-prefix full_scheme_photo --animate
```

Running this will take a bit more time as we now have the influence of photochemistry on the ODE.

This will generate the result file `hd209458_full_scheme_photo.h5` as well as plots and video labelled `full_scheme_photo_solution.png` and `full_scheme_photo_animation.mp4` respectively. LEts take a look at the plot output:
![full_scheme_photo_solution.png](quickstart/full_scheme_photo_solution.png)

You may have noticed that we now have the lower right plot showing the actinic flux. This is the flux that is incident on the planet.

Finally lets take a look at the video output:

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    <source src="full_scheme_photo_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>
This is the final result! We can see that the photochemistry has a large effect on the upper atmosphere. The lower atmosphere is not affected as much.

## Custom system

We've done a a lot of work so far so lets take a theoretical planet and star and see what it would look like!

### Planet

Lets define a planet with the following parameters:

- Mass: 20.0 $M_{e}$
- Radius: 20.0 $R_{e}$
- Semi-major axis: 1.0 AU

We can define it in the input file as follows:

```yaml
planet:
  mass: 20.0 Mearth
  radius: 20.0 Rearth
  distance: 1.0 AU
```

For the star, lets assume we have a sun-like star with the following parameters:

- Radius: 2.2 $R_{\odot}$
- Temperature: 4000 K

Again these are arbitrary values. We can actually make use of the built-in spectra to generate a new spectra using the `rescale` options. This is how we would define it:

```yaml
star:
  incident_angle: 45 deg
  spectrum:
    format: rescale
    from_star: sun
    temperature: 4000 K
    radius: 2.2 Rsun
```

Finally let us use the same temperature-pressure profile as before. We can use the same `tpprofile.csv` file as before but we will lower $K_{zz}$ to $10^{4}~\frac{cm}{s^2}$. We can define it in the input file as follows:

```yaml
atmosphere:
  tp_profile:
    format: from-file
    filename: tpprofile.csv
    temperature_column: 1
    pressure_column: 0
    comments: "#"
    temperature_unit: K
    pressure_unit: mbar

  kzz: 1e4 cm2/s
```

We can then run the command. Assuming we save this as `custom.yml` we can run the command:

```bash
$ freckll custom.yml -o custom.h5 --plot --plot-prefix custom --animate
```

This will generate the result file `custom.h5` as well as plots and video labelled `custom_solution.png` and `custom_animation.mp4` respectively.

![custom_solution.png](quickstart/custom_solution.png)

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    <source src="custom_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>

## Conclusion

This is a quick overview of how to use the command line program. We have seen how to run a reduced chemical scheme, a full chemical scheme and add in photochemistry. We have also seen how to modify the input file to change the parameters of the system. Finally we have seen how to generate plots and videos of the results.
