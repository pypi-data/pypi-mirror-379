An extensively validated C/H/O/N chemical network for hot exoplanets disequilibrium chemistry
See Veillet et al., 2023, A&A

This is the FRECKLL folder used for the exoplanet study in the above paper. It also contains the same network as uploaded on KIDA, but in the FRECKLL format.
In essence the format is similar to KIDA with the exception of the pre-exponential factor which is expressed without reference temperature (A*T^n*exp(-E/T) instead of A*(T/300K)^n*exp(-E/T)).
In the folder "V23_metallicity_1_kzz_1e+09.par", you will find an example of how to use this network with FRECKLL.
Further information on the FRECKLL format can be found at the ArXiv link (https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11203) and will be accessible on the GitHub repository when the code is published.
