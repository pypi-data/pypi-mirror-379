# Template Catalog

Copy files from this directory into `.spec-dev/active-dev/` or `.spec-dev/active-memories/`
as needed.

## Active Cycle Templates (`active/`)
| Template | Copy To | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `plan-template.md` | `active-plan.md` | Seed for Plan & Intent phase.
| `tasks-template.md` | `active-tasks.md` | Seed for Tasks board.
| `implementation-log-template.md` | `active-implementation.md` | Seed for implementation log.

## Optional Appendices (`appendices/`)
| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `discovery-appendix-template.md` | Personas, journeys, and discovery notes when extra context is needed. |
| `nfr-budget-template.md` | Track performance, reliability, security, and accessibility targets. |

## Memory Templates (`memories/`)
| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `task-memory-template.md` | Blank scaffold for new task memories (`T-XXX-memory.md`); keep only the sections that fit. |
| `task-memory-example.md` | Completed example showing a concise, high-signal write-up. |

Guidelines:
1. Copy the template, rename to the canonical filename, and update header metadata.
2. Drop active templates into `.spec-dev/active-dev/`, appendices next to them when needed, and memory templates into `.spec-dev/active-memories/`.
3. Keep the Backlog/In Progress/Done sections intact; move cards with the CLI helpers instead of deleting them.
4. Remove instructional comments as you fill in real content.
5. Leave templates untouched so future cycles start with a clean slate.
