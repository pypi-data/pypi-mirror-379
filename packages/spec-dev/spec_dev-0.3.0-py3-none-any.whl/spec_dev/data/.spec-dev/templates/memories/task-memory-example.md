# T-042 — Harden session cookie handling (Shipped, 2025-09-10 — 2025-09-12)

## Why It Mattered
- SEV-2 incident showed session tokens leaking without the `Secure` flag.
- Compliance control C-17 required hardened cookies before the Q3 release.

## What Changed
- Centralized cookie helper now forces `Secure` + `SameSite=Lax`.
- Updated Next.js middleware to consume the new helper.
- Added dashboard panels tracking cookie rejection and login success.

## How It Was Done
1. Audited all cookie writes; legacy helper in `auth/cookies.ts` was missing flags.
2. Replaced call sites with the new helper and added unit coverage for variants.
3. Paired with QA on Safari/iOS flows; resolved a stale cache issue via cache busting.

## Validation & Proof
- **Checks:** Jest unit tests, Cypress smoke suite, manual Safari QA.
- **Results:** All pass; login success dipped 0.2% (within agreed tolerance).
- **Approvals:** Security (A. Patel) and QA (L. Gomez).

## Artifacts
- PR #128 — https://example.com/repos/web/pulls/128
- Branch `feature/session-cookie-hardening`
- Dashboard https://grafana.example.com/d/COOKIES/auth-cookie-health

## Ripple Effects
- Follow-up T-050 scheduled to tighten CSP headers.
- Monitoring login success and cookie rejection alerts for two weeks post-release.

## Lessons Learned
- Keep Safari QA in the loop early; caching quirks keep resurfacing on iOS.
