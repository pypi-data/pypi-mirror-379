# Session Summaries

Use this directory to store hand-off summaries whenever you swap agents or pause
a cycle. Run `spec-dev session` to scaffold the next `session-XXX.md` file, then
fill it with:

- What phases/tasks were completed in this session.
- Key decisions and context the next agent needs to know.
- Where work stopped and the very next action.
- Open questions or risks worth monitoring.

Agents that spin up later should read these session files before resuming work.
Delete or archive session files only after the cycle is complete.
