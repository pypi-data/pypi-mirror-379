# Active Development Artifacts

This directory holds the live working copies for the current SDD cycle.

Getting started:
1. Copy the relevant templates from `.spec-dev/templates/`.
2. Rename them to the canonical filenames (`active-plan.md`, `active-tasks.md`, `active-implementation.md`).
3. Populate each file according to the instructions in `.spec-dev/*.md`.
4. Delete this README once real artifacts are in place.

The directory should only contain the files that reflect the
Plan & Intent → Tasks → Implement loop (plus any optional appendices you link from the plan).
