# Usage

!!! question "Do I have to install the Tailwind CLI?"

    **No.** The management commands of this library handle the download and installation of the Tailwind CLI. You don't have to deal with this. But you can configure the installation location and the version of the CLI you want to use. Take a look at the [settings](settings.md) section.

!!! question "Do I have to create my own `css/source.css` for Tailwind 4.x?"

    **No.** The management commands also take care of this step. If no `css/source.css` is present in your project, a new one with sane defaults will be created. Afterwards this file will be used and be customized by you. The default location for the file is first folder from the `STATICFILES_DIRS` of your project, but you can change this. Take a look at the [settings](settings.md) section.

## Management commands

### build

Run `python manage.py tailwind build` to create an optimized production built of the stylesheet. Afterwards you are ready to deploy. Take care the this command is run before `python manage.py collectstatic` in your build process.

### watch

Run `python manage.py tailwind watch` to just start a tailwind watcher process if you prefer to start your debug server in a seperate shell or prefer a different solution than runserver or runserver_plus.

### runserver

Run `python manage.py tailwind runserver` to start the classic Django debug server in parallel to a tailwind watcher process.

```shell
Usage: manage.py tailwind runserver
           [OPTIONS] [ADDRPORT]

  Run the development server with Tailwind CSS CLI in watch mode.

  If django-extensions is installed along with this library, this command runs
  the runserver_plus command from django-extensions. Otherwise it runs the
  default runserver command.

Arguments:
  [ADDRPORT]  Optional port number, or ipaddr:port

Options:
  -6, --ipv6                      Tells Django to use an IPv6 address.
  --nothreading                   Tells Django to NOT use threading.
  --nostatic                      Tells Django to NOT automatically serve
                                  static files at STATIC_URL.
  --noreload                      Tells Django to NOT use the auto-reloader.
  --skip-checks                   Skip system checks.
  --pdb                           Drop into pdb shell at the start of any
                                  view. (Requires django-extensions.)
  --ipdb                          Drop into ipdb shell at the start of any
                                  view. (Requires django-extensions.)
  --pm                            Drop into (i)pdb shell if an exception is
                                  raised in a view. (Requires django-
                                  extensions.)
  --print-sql                     Print SQL queries as they're executed.
                                  (Requires django-extensions.)
  --print-sql-location            Show location in code where SQL query
                                  generated from. (Requires django-
                                  extensions.)
  --cert-file TEXT                SSL .crt file path. If not provided path
                                  from --key-file will be selected. Either
                                  --cert-file or --key-file must be provided
                                  to use SSL. (Requires django-extensions.)
  --key-file TEXT                 SSL .key file path. If not provided path
                                  from --cert-file will be selected. Either
                                  --cert-file or --key-file must be provided
                                  to use SSL. (Requires django-extensions.)
  --force-default-runserver / --no-force-default-runserver
                                  Force the use of the default runserver
                                  command even if django-extensions is
                                  installed.   [default: no-force-default-
                                  runserver]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

### list_templates

Run `python manage.py tailwind list_templates` to find all templates in your django project. This is handy for a setup where you dynamically build the list of files being analyzed by tailwindcss.

### download_cli

Run `python manage.py tailwind download_cli` to just download the CLI. This commands downloads the correct version of the CLI for your platform and stores it in the path configured by the `TAILWIND_CLI_PATH` setting.

### config

Run `python manage.py tailwind config` to show current Tailwind CSS configuration. This command displays the current configuration settings and their values, helping you understand how django-tailwind-cli is configured in your project.

The command shows:
- All configuration paths (CLI, CSS input/output)
- Version information
- Django settings values
- File existence status
- Platform information

### setup

Run `python manage.py tailwind setup` to launch the interactive setup guide for django-tailwind-cli. This command provides step-by-step guidance for setting up Tailwind CSS in your Django project, from installation to first build.

The guide covers:
1. Installation verification
2. Django settings configuration
3. CLI binary download
4. First CSS build
5. Template integration
6. Development workflow

This is perfect for first-time setup, troubleshooting configuration issues, or learning the development workflow.

### troubleshoot

Run `python manage.py tailwind troubleshoot` to access the troubleshooting guide for common issues. This command provides solutions for the most common issues encountered when using django-tailwind-cli, with step-by-step debugging guidance.

Common issues covered:
- CSS not updating in browser
- Build failures and errors
- Missing or incorrect configuration
- Permission and download issues
- Template integration problems

### optimize

Run `python manage.py tailwind optimize` to view performance optimization tips and best practices. This command provides detailed guidance on optimizing your Tailwind CSS build performance and development workflow for the best possible experience.

Areas covered:
- Build performance optimization
- File watching efficiency
- Template scanning optimization
- Production deployment best practices
- Development workflow improvements
- Common performance pitfalls

### remove_cli

Run `python manage.py tailwind remove_cli` to remove the installed cli.

### watch

Run `python manage.py tailwind watch` to just start a tailwind watcher process if you prefer to start your debug server in a seperate shell or prefer a different solution than runserver or runserver_plus.

## Use with Docker Compose

When used in the `watch` mode, the Tailwind CLI requires a TTY-enabled environment to function correctly. In a Docker Compose setup, ensure that the container executing the Tailwind style rebuild command (either `python manage.py tailwind runserver` or `python manage.py tailwind watch`, as noted above) is configured with the `tty: true` setting in your `docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
web:
  command: python manage.py tailwind runserver
  tty: true

# or

tailwind-sidecar:
  command: python manage.py tailwind watch
  tty: true
```

## Use with daisyUI

If you plan to use [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com), there is an easy way to solve this with this library.

```python
TAILWIND_CLI_USE_DAISY_UI = True
```

Setting this, the library switches from using the default TailwindCSS CLI to the one provided by [Andris Dobiƒçinaitis](https://github.com/dobicinaitis) and his [tailwind-cli-extra](https://github.com/dobicinaitis/tailwind-cli-extra) project. It also causes the library to create a proper default config that activates the daisyUI plugin.

But of course you can do it manually, too. Just configure a repository where the library should pull the CLI from and activate the daisyUI support.

```python
TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_REPO = "dobicinaitis/tailwind-cli-extra"
TAILWIND_CLI_ASSET_NAME = "tailwindcss-extra"
TAILWIND_CLI_USE_DAISY_UI = True
```

Or provide your custom configuration, too.

```python
TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_REPO = "dobicinaitis/tailwind-cli-extra"
TAILWIND_CLI_ASSET_NAME = "tailwindcss-extra"
TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_CSS = "etc/source.css"
```

## Use with WhiteNoise

If you are using [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to serve your static assets, you must not put your custom Tailwind configuration file inside any of the directories for static files. WhiteNoise stumbles across the `@import "tailwindcss";` statement, because it can't resolve it.

If you want to use a custom configuration for Tailwind CSS, put it somewhere else in the project.
