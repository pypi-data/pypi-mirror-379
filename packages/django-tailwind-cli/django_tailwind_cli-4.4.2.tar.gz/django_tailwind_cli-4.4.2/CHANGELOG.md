## 4.2.4

- Merged pull request [#161](https://github.com/django-commons/django-tailwind-cli/pull/161) by [@adamghill](https://github.com/adamghill) which fixed the [prefix handling for staticfiles diretories](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/settings/#prefixes-optional).

## 4.2.3

- Reverted the decision to store the CLI and the default config file in proper platform dirs.

  * Windows has issues with the paths or sometimes it is not possible to create them.
  * VSCode Tailwind Plugin relies on the the existance of the config within the current project.
  * Decision: Create a folder named `.django_tailwind_cli` within the project and store the files there.

## 4.2.2

- Default configuration stored in the user cache directory is overwritten on every start of the debug server or other management command.

## 4.2.1

- Bugfix for determining the latest release of the used version of Tailwind CSS.

## 4.2.0

> [!CAUTION]
> Version 4.2.x and onward only support Tailwind CSS 4.x. If you are using Tailwind CSS 3.x,
> please use version 2.21.1 of this library. Version 4.0.x or 4.1.x still support Tailwind CSS 3.x, but
> these versions are not recommended to use for new projects.

> [!CAUTION]
> This version includes changes to the handling of `TAILWIND_CLI_PATH` and `TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_CSS`.

- Default fallback version is now 4.1.3.
- Removed support for Tailwind CSS 3.x. The main reason is that this makes the library easier to maintain and also add better support for custom CLI builds which support DaisyUI and other plugins.
- django-tailwind-cli now uses proper platform directories to store the CLI binary.

    * The proper directories are powered by [platformdirs](https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/).
    * `TAILWIND_CLI_PATH` is now optional by default.
    * If `TAILWIND_CLI_PATH` is None, the binary is stored in `user_data_dir("django-tailwind-cli", "django-commons")`.
    * The library doesn't rely anylonger on a properly set `settings.BASE_DIR`.

- `TAILWIND_CLI_ASSET_NAME` is also used for the downloaded CLI to distinguish between `tailwindcss` and `tailwindcss-extra`.
- The behaviour of `TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_CSS` has been changed. The reasoning behind this change was, less default code inside the project and whitenoise had issues with a CSS file inside an asset folder referencing non-existing imports.

    * It defaults to `None`.
    * If it is `None` the default input file is created in the user cache directory.
    * If it is a relative path, this path is considered relative to `settings.BASE_DIR`.
    * The last option is an absolute path.

- Proper daisyUI support using [tailwind-cli-extra](https://github.com/dobicinaitis/tailwind-cli-extra).

## 4.1.0

- TAILWIND_CLI_VERSION defaults to "latest" now. In case it is set to this value,
  django-tailwind-cli tries to determine which version is the latest version of Tailwind CSS. If it is not able to access the internet, it uses a fallback version defined in django_tailwind_cli.config.FALLBACK_VERSION. Currently,
  it is set to 4.0.6.

## 4.0.1

- Various fixes for the documentation.
- Added Django 5.2 to the testing matrix.

## 4.0.0

- Added support for Tailwind CSS 4.0.0.
- Default version is Tailwind CSS 4.0.0.
- The versioning is now aligned with Tailwind CSS. That means the major number of this packages
  follows the major number of Tailwind CSS to document the most recent supported version of Tailwind.
- Removed the management commands `install_pycharm_workaround` and `uninstall_pycharm_workaround`.
  This feature broke too often.
- Removed `runserver_plus` subcommand. The management subcommand `runserver` now starts either the
  debug server from django-extensions if this package is installed. Otherwise it starts the standard
  debug server.
- The management subcommand `runserver` got an option `--force-default-runserver` to enforce the
  usage of the standard debug server from Django.
- `TAILWIND_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` isn't necessary for Tailwind CSS 4.x only for 3.x.
  [Read the documentaiton about it.](https://django-tailwind-cli.rtfd.io/latest/installation/settings)
- Removed the documentation for the fancier `tailwind.config.js` as it is not recommended to use
  and Tailwind CSS 4.x has a way better strategy to find the used Tailwind classes.

## 2.21.1

- Relaxed the minimum Django version to >=4.0.

## 2.21.0
