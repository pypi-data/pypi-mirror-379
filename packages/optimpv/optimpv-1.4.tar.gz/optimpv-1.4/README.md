## Description
This repository contains the code to run **optimPV**. optimPV combines sevral optimization procedures and modeling utilities that can be used for two objectives:
1. to optimize the parameters of a simulation to fit experimental data.
2. to optimize the processing conditions in a self-driving experimental set-up.

## Installation
### With pip
To install optimPV with pip you have two options:
1. Install optimPV using the [PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/optimpv/)  

    ```bash
    pip install optimpv
    ```

2. Install optimPV using the GitHub repository   https://github.com/openPV-lab/optimPV

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/openPV-lab/optimPV
    ```

### With conda
To install optimPV with conda:

```bash
conda create -n optimpv 
conda activate optimpv
pip install optimpv
```

You can also clone your base environment:

```bash  
conda create -n optimpv --clone base
```

## Additional necessary installs for the agents
### Drift-diffusion agent
The drift-diffusion agent uses [SIMsalabim](https://github.com/kostergroup/SIMsalabim) to run drift-diffusion simulations.

- SIMsalabim is included as a submodule.
- Install it following the instructions on the [SIMsalabim GitHub repository](https://github.com/kostergroup/SIMsalabim).
- Only works for parallel simulations on Linux. All other optimPV agents work on Windows.

### Parallel simulations
To run parallel simulations on Linux you can also install GNU Parallel:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install parallel
```
