# Set the debug level - higer levels produce more output
# int - larger or equal to zero
#   0 - No debug output
#   1 - Top level debug output
#   2 - Iteration level output - not needed in most cases, useful for development 
#       and debugging
# Default is 0

# Subdirectory that contains the images
# string - path to the images subdirectory
# Default is images

# Number of CPU's to use in the analysis.  If set to auto the code
# will use all available CPU's
# NB Using auto is generally not a good idea as it may overload the system and
#    thus slow down the runtime.  For example, on my 8 core machine using
#    CPUCount = 4 gives the best overall runtime.  Also using multiple cores has 
#    a bigger effect on jobs with longer run times - eg when using many subsets, 
#    and/or when using Quadratic shape functions and IG-LM
#
#    Setting CPUCount to 1 will run a serial version of the code
#
# int - larger or equal to 1 or auto
# Default is 1

# Set the type of DIC to perform
# string - Planar | Stereo
#   Planar - 2D DIC using a single camera is performed

# of points will be the number of starting points squared.

# Default is 4

# The reference startegy between images if more than two images is supplied
# string - Relative | Absolute
#   Absolute - The reference image is the first image - no change in ROI.
#              Useful for small deformations

#              each image pair.  Useful for large deformations
# Default is Relative

# Cutoff value to detect all black background in image
# This value will be used to detect all black (< Cutoff) areas in the image.  This

# sample.  However, the background MUST be black
# int - larger or equal to 0

# interpolation should be a bit more stable while the 5th order should be a bit more
# accurate.  There is not a big computational cost difference between the two and the
# 3rd order should be sufficient for most applications.
# it should be sufficient for most applications.

# The next two parameters control the convergence behavior of the optimizer.  The 
# optimization will stop when either the change in subset center point displacement is 
# less than the ConvergenceTreshold value OR when the NZCC value is above the NZCCThreshold 
# value.

# Convergence threshold for the change in subset center point displacement magnitude.
# float - larger or equal to 0.0
#       - setting this value to 0 will disable this convergence check

# Convergence threshold for the NZCC value.  This value has a maximum value of one
# which would indicate perfect correlation.
