See how to use OptiPFair's core features in just a few lines of code.

### Pruning with the Python API

Prune 20% of the MLP neurons from a model using the Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) method.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from optipfair import prune_model

# Load a pre-trained model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B")

# Prune 20% of neurons from MLP layers
pruned_model, stats = prune_model(
    model=model,
    pruning_type="MLP_GLU",
    neuron_selection_method="MAW",
    pruning_percentage=20,
    show_progress=True,
    return_stats=True
)

# Print pruning statistics
print(f"Original parameters: {stats['original_parameters']:,}")
print(f"Pruned parameters: {stats['pruned_parameters']:,}")
print(f"Reduction: {stats['reduction']:,} parameters ({stats['percentage_reduction']:.2f}%)")

# Save the pruned model
pruned_model.save_pretrained("./pruned-llama-model")
```
The pruning process yields tangible results in model size and performance. Here's a sample comparison for **Llama-3.2-1B** after pruning 20% of its MLP neurons:

| Metric | Original Model | Pruned Model | Improvement |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Total Parameters** | 1.24B | 1.07B | **-13.03%** |
| **Inference Speed** | *Benchmark in progress* | *Benchmark in progress* | *Coming soon* |
| **MMLU Score** | *Benchmark in progress* | *Benchmark in progress* | *Minimal change expected* |

*Results based on the [MAW pruning method](#neuron-selection-methods). Full benchmark results will be published shortly.*

### Pruning Transformer Layers (Depth Pruning)

Remove entire layers from a model for significant efficiency gains. Here, we remove the last 4 layers.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from optipfair import prune_model

# Load a pre-trained model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B")

# Remove the last 4 transformer layers
pruned_model, stats = prune_model(
    model=model,
    pruning_type="DEPTH",
    num_layers_to_remove=4,
    layer_selection_method="last", # Recommended for best performance retention
    show_progress=True,
    return_stats=True
)

# Print pruning statistics
print(f"Original layers: {stats['original_layers']}")
print(f"Pruned layers: {stats['pruned_layers']}")
print(f"Reduction: {stats['reduction']:,} parameters ({stats['percentage_reduction']:.2f}%)")

# Save the pruned model
pruned_model.save_pretrained("./pruned-depth-llama-model")
```

### Analyzing Layer Importance
Before performing Depth Pruning, you can analyze which layers are the most redundant. This function measures the cosine similarity between the input and output of each transformer layer‚Äîa higher similarity (lower distance score) suggests the layer has less impact on the final representation.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import torch
from optipfair import analyze_layer_importance

# 1. Load a model and tokenizer
model_name = "distilgpt2"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
if tokenizer.pad_token is None:
    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

# 2. Prepare a sample dataloader (this is the user's responsibility)
dummy_texts = ["This is a sample sentence." for _ in range(16)]
inputs = tokenizer(dummy_texts, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=128)
dataset = TensorDataset(inputs['input_ids'], inputs['attention_mask'])
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=8)

# 3. Analyze layer importance
# The function returns a dictionary {layer_index: importance_score}
# where importance is 1 - cosine_similarity
importance_scores = analyze_layer_importance(model, dataloader)

# 4. Print the results, sorted by importance (less important first)
sorted_layers = sorted(importance_scores.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])
print("Layer importance scores (lower is less important):")
for layer_idx, score in sorted_layers:
    print(f"  Layer {layer_idx}: {score:.4f}")

# The layers with the lowest scores are potential candidates for pruning.
```


### Visualizing Bias with the Python API
Generate visualizations to analyze how a model's activations differ when processing prompts with varying demographic attributes.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from optipfair.bias import visualize_bias

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Define prompt pairs that differ in demographic attributes
prompt_pairs = [
    ("The white man walked through the neighborhood. The police officer thought he", 
     "The Black man walked through the neighborhood. The police officer thought he")
]

# Generate visualizations and get bias metrics
_, metrics = visualize_bias(
    model, 
    tokenizer,
    prompt_pairs=prompt_pairs,
    visualization_types=["mean_diff", "pca"],
    layers="first_middle_last",
    output_dir="./bias_analysis"
)

# Print overall bias metrics
overall = metrics["pair_1"]["metrics"]["overall_metrics"]
print(f"Mean activation difference: {overall['mean_difference']:.6f}")
```
The code above generates the following types of visualizations, allowing for a deep dive into model fairness:
| ![Mean Image Differences](/images/mean_image_differences.png) | ![activation_differences_layer.png](/images/activation_differences_layer.png) | ![pca_analysis.png](/images/pca_analysis.png)

## Dive Deeper: Features & Concepts

For those who want to understand the nuts and bolts of OptiPFair.

### Supported Models
OptiPFair is designed to work with transformer-based language models that use GLU architecture in their MLP layers. This includes most modern LLMs:

* **LLaMA family** (LLaMA, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3)
* **Mistral** models
* **Gemma** models
* **Qwen** models
* ... and other models with a similar GLU architecture.

### Pruning Strategies: Neurons vs. Layers

OptiPFair offers two powerful structured pruning strategies:

1.  **MLP Pruning (Width Pruning)**: Reduces the number of neurons within the MLP layers of GLU-based models. This is a fine-grained approach to improve efficiency. You can control it via `pruning_percentage` or a target `expansion_rate`. It uses several neuron importance metrics:
    * **MAW (Maximum Absolute Weight)**: Default and most effective method.
    * **VOW (Variance of Weights)**
    * **PON (Product of Norms)**

2.  **Depth Pruning (Layer Pruning)**: Removes entire transformer layers from the model. This is a more aggressive technique that can yield significant reductions in parameters and latency. It's universally compatible with most transformer architectures. You can define which layers to remove by:
    * **Number**: `num_layers_to_remove=4`
    * **Percentage**: `depth_pruning_percentage=25`
    * **Specific Indices**: `layer_indices=[12, 13, 14, 15]`
  
### Understanding Model Internals: Layer Importance Analysis
Before deciding which layers to remove with Depth Pruning, you can assess their relative importance. OptiPFair provides a method based on the cosine similarity between a layer's input and output embeddings.

* **How it works**: The analyze_layer_importance function passes data through the model and uses hooks to capture the input and output of each transformer layer. It then calculates a score based on 1 - cosine_similarity.
* **Interpretation**: A low score indicates that a layer alters its input representation minimally. These layers are strong candidates for removal via Depth Pruning, as their impact on the model's overall function may be less critical. This analysis provides data-driven insights to guide your pruning strategy.
