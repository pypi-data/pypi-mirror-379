              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# ViData: Vision Data Management, Processing and Analysis

> A unified Python toolkit for managing, processing, and analyzing vision datasets, from raw data to task specific analytics.
>
> Streamlines the entire data pipeline for computer vision and medical imaging:
>
> - Load and save 2D/3D data across common formats with a consistent API.
> - Organize datasets using flexible file managers and YAML-based configs.
> - Handle task-aware data (images, semantic masks, multilabel masks) with clear shape and axis conventions.
> - Analyze dataset statistics and inspect data interactively with CLI tools and Napari integration.

# Installation

```bash
pip install vidata
# or latest dev version
git clone https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/vidata.git
cd vidata
pip install -e ./

# (optional - for visual inspections)
pip install napari-data-inspection
```

# Features

- **Unified I/O**: Load and save 2D images, 3D volumes, n-dim arrays, and configs with consistent `load_xxx` / `save_xxx` API.
- **Supported Formats**: PNG, TIFF, NIfTI, NRRD, NumPy, Blosc2, JSON, YAML, Pickle, Text
- **Loaders & Writers**: Task-aware data handling for images, semantic segmentation, and multilabel masks (single-file or stacked).
- **File Management**: Collect files with patterns, filters, and split definitions.
- **Task-Aware Handling**: Built-in support for semantic and multilabel segmentation masks with shape and axis conventions.
- **Flexible Dataset Configs**: Define datasets in YAML with layers, modalities, labels, and optional splits/folds.
- **Analysis & Inspection Tools**: CLI for dataset statistics and a Napari plugin for visual inspection.

# Module Overview

| Module                                | Purpose                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`io`](#io)                           | Provides low-level reading and writing support for multiple file types.                                 |
| [`loader`](#loaderswriters)           | Wraps `io` with task-specific logic to load data in correct format.                                     |
| [`writers`](#loaderswriters)          | Wraps `io` with task-specific logic to write data in correct format.                                    |
| [`task_manager`](#task-manager)       | Encapsulates logic for handling semantic and multi-label segmentation data.                             |
| [`file_manager`](#file-manager)       | Handles file selection and organization using paths, patterns and splits.                               |
| [`config_manager`](#config-manager)   | Parses dataset configuration files and instantiates loaders, writers, file managers, and task managers. |
| [`data_analyzer`](#data-analysis)     | Computes and visualizes dataset statistics.                                                             |
| [`data_inspection`](#data-inspection) | Inspect your data (Requires napari_data_inspection to be installed)                                     |

# IO

**TL;DR;**

- Use `load_xxx` / `save_xxx` for all supported formats.
- **Images/arrays:** PNG/JPG/TIFF (`imageio`, `tifffile`), NIfTI/NRRD/MHA (`sitk`, `nibabel`), Blosc2, NumPy (`.npy`, `.npz`).
- **Configs/metadata:** JSON, YAML, Pickle, TXT.
- **Extendable** by custom _load_ and _save_ functions.
- Functions always follow the same pattern:

```python
data, meta = load_xxx("file.ext")
save_xxx(data, "out.ext", meta)
```

### Custom Load and Save Functions

- Register a reader / writer with a decorator.
- Reader must return (numpy_array, metadata_dict).
- Writer must return list\[str\] of the file(s) it wrote.
- Registration happens at import time‚Äîmake sure this module is imported (e.g., from your package‚Äôs __init__.py).
- See [here](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/ViData/blob/main/src/vidata/io/image_io.py) for an example.

# Loaders/Writers

**TL;DR;**

- Use `ImageLoader/Writer`, `SemSegLoader/Writer`, `MultilabelLoader/Writer` for **single-file** data.
- Use `ImageStackLoader/Writer`, `MultilabelStackedLoader/Writer` when **channels/classes are split across files** (`*_0000`, `*_0001`, ‚Ä¶).
- Some formats support multiple backends (e.g., `.nii.gz` ‚Üí `sitk`, `nibabel`).

```python
from vidata.loaders import ImageLoader
from vidata.writers import ImageWriter

# Minimal example: load an image and save it again
loader = ImageLoader(ftype=".png", channels=3)
writer = ImageWriter(ftype=".png")

image, meta = loader.load("example.png")
writer.save(image, "out.png", meta)
```

<details>
<summary> Expand for Full Details </summary>

## Single-file loaders/writers

Use these loaders when each image or label is stored in a **single file**.

```py
from vidata.loaders import ImageLoader, SemSegLoader, MultilabelLoader
from vidata.writers import ImageWriter, SemSegWriter, MultilabelWriter

# Image Loader/Writer
loader = ImageLoader(ftype=".png")
writer = ImageWriter(ftype=".png")
image, meta = loader.load("path/to/file.png")
writer.save(image,"path/to/output.png",meta)

# Semantic Segmentation Loader/Writer
loader = SemSegLoader(ftype=".png")
writer = SemSegWriter(ftype=".png")
mask, meta = loader.load("path/to/file.png")
writer.save(mask,"path/to/output.png",meta)

# Multilabel Segmentation Loader/Writer
loader = MultilabelLoader(ftype=".png")
writer = MultilabelWriter(ftype=".png")
mask, meta = loader.load("path/to/file.png")
writer.save(mask,"path/to/output.png",meta)
```

## Stacked loaders/writers

Use these loaders when each channel (image) or class (labels) is stored in a separate file.
Files must follow a numeric suffix convention: file_0000.png, file_0001.png, etc.
Only exists for Image and Multilabel Loaders

```py
from vidata.loaders import ImageStackLoader, MultilabelStackedLoader
from vidata.writers import ImageStackWriter, MultilabelStackedWriter

# Image Loader
#       expects multiple files with numeric suffixes: file_0000.png, file_0001.png, file_0002.png
loader = ImageStackLoader(ftype=".png", channels=3)           # channels=3 --> 3 files are expected
writer = ImageStackWriter(ftype=".png", channels=3)           # channels=3 --> 3 files are expected
image, meta = loader.load("path/to/file")                     # Pass only the base path without suffix and file_type
writer.save(image,"path/to/output.png",meta)                  # each channel will be saved in a separate file

# Multilabel Segmentation Loader
#       expects file names: file_0000.png,... , file_0006.png
loader = MultilabelStackedLoader(ftype=".png", classes=7)     # classes=7 --> 7 files are expected
writer = MultilabelStackedWriter(ftype=".png", classes=7)     # classes=7 --> 7 files are expected
mask, meta = loader.load("path/to/file")                      # Pass only the base path without suffix and file_type
writer.save(mask,"path/to/output.png",meta)                   # each class will be saved in a separate file
```

## Backend selection

Some file types support multiple backends. You can explicitly select one (Analogue for all Loaders and Writers):

```py
from vidata.loaders import ImageLoader

# Explicit backend (SimpleITK)
loader=ImageLoader(ftype=".nii.gz",channels=1, backend="sitk")
image, meta = loader.load("path/to/file.nii.gz")

# Explicit backend (Nibabel)
loader=ImageLoader(ftype=".nii.gz",channels=1, backend="nibabel")
image, meta = loader.load("path/to/file.nii.gz")

# If not specified the first one from the table below is chosen (SimpleITK in this case)
loader=ImageLoader(ftype=".nii.gz",channels=1)
image, meta = loader.load("path/to/file.nii.gz")
```

| Data Type      | Extension(s)                    | Available Backends    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Image/Mask** | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp` | `imageio`             |

| **Image/Mask** | `.b2nd`                         | `blosc2`, `blosc2pkl` |
| **Image/Mask** | `.npy`                          | `numpy`               |

# Task Manager

**TL;DR;**

- Use `SemanticSegmentationManager` for **single-label masks** (each voxel has one class ID).
- Use `MultiLabelSegmentationManager` for **multi-label masks** (channel-first one-hot).
- Provides utilities to generate dummy masks, list class IDs, count pixels, and locate classes.

```python
from vidata.task_manager import SemanticSegmentationManager

tm = SemanticSegmentationManager()
mask = tm.random((128, 128), num_classes=3)
print(tm.class_ids(mask))  # -> e.g. [0, 1, 2]
```

<details>
<summary> Expand for Full Details </summary>

The task managers provide a unified interface for **semantic segmentation** and **multilabel segmentation** labels, with utilities to generate dummy data, inspect class distributions, and query spatial properties.

```py
from vidata.task_manager import (
    SemanticSegmentationManager,
    MultiLabelSegmentationManager,
)

# Semantic segmentation (2D example)
ssm = SemanticSegmentationManager()

mask = ssm.random(size, num_classes)       # shape: (H, W) or (D, H, W), dtype=int, range: [0:num_classes]
empty = ssm.empty(size, num_classes)       # zeros by default
ids = ssm.class_ids(mask)                  # sorted unique class IDs (e.g., [0,1,2,3,4])
count_bg = ssm.class_count(mask, 1)        # number of pixels/voxels with class 1
coords = ssm.class_location(mask, 3)       # indices (tuple of arrays) where class==3
spatial = ssm.spatial_dims(mask.shape)     # (H, W) or (D, H, W)
has_bg = ssm.has_background()              # True (class 0 is background)

# Multilabel segmentation (3D example)
mlm = MultiLabelSegmentationManager()
ml_mask = mlm.random(size, num_classes)    # shape: (N, H, W) or (N, D, H, W), channel-first one-hot
ml_empty = mlm.empty(size, num_classes)    # all zeros
ml_ids = mlm.class_ids(ml_mask)            # sorted unique class IDs (e.g., [0,1,2,3,4])
ml_count = mlm.class_count(ml_mask, 2)     # number of pixels/voxels where channel 2 is active
ml_coords = mlm.class_location(ml_mask, 6) # indices (tuple of arrays) where channel 6 is active
ml_spatial = mlm.spatial_dims(ml_mask.shape) # (H, W) or (D, H, W)
mlm.has_background()                       # False (class 0 is not background)
```

</details>

# File Manager

**TL;DR;**

- Use `FileManager` to collect **single-file samples** (`*.png`, `*.nii.gz`, ‚Ä¶).
- Use `FileManagerStacked` when **samples are split across multiple files** (`*_0000`, `*_0001`, ‚Ä¶).
- Supports `pattern`, `include_names`, and `exclude_names` filters.
- Returns a list-like object (`len()`, indexing).

```python
from vidata.file_manager import FileManager

fm = FileManager(path="data/images", file_type=".png")
print(len(fm), "files found")
print(fm[0])  # -> Path('data/images/example.png')
```

<details>
<summary> Expand for Full Details </summary>

The `file_manager` module collects files from a root directory with optional
**pattern**, **include**/**exclude** filters, and a variant for **stacked** files
(e.g., `*_0000.*`, `*_0001.*`).

```py
from vidata.file_manager import FileManager

# Single-file data (e.g., images or masks stored one-per-file)
fm = FileManager(
    path="data/images",
    file_type=".png",
    pattern="*_image",            # optional; glob-like,
    include_names=["case_","sample_"], # optional; keep only if any token is in file name
    exclude_names=["corrupt"],   # optional; drop if any token is in file name
)
print(len(fm), "files")           # > 30 files | how many files are found
print(fm[0])                      # > data/images/case_1_image.png
```

Use FileManagerStacked when each sample is stored across multiple files with a
numeric suffix (e.g., channels or classes): file_0000.ext, file_0001.ext, ‚Ä¶

```py
from vidata.file_manager import FileManagerStacked

# Single-file data (e.g., images or masks stored one-per-file)
fm = FileManagerStacked(
    path="data/stacked_images",
    file_type=".png",
    pattern="*_image",            # optional; glob-like,
    include_names=["case_","sample_"], # optional; keep only if any token is in file name
    exclude_names=["corrupt"],   # optional; drop if any token is in file name
)
print(len(fm), "files")           # > 30 files | how many files are found (number of base path)
print(fm[0])                      # > data/stacked_images/case_1_image | gives the base path without suffix and dtype
```

</details>

# Config Template

**TL;DR;**

- Config is a YAML **template for datasets**: always starts with a `name`.
- Add one or more **layers** (e.g., `image`, `semseg`, `multilabel`) with fields like `path`, `file_type`, `channels`/`classes`.
- **Optional splits**: define `train/val/test` overrides or point to a `splits_file`.
- See [`examples/template.yaml`](examples/template.yaml) and/or run `vidata_template` for a template

<details>
<summary> Expand for Full Details </summary>

A config is a YAML file describing the dataset name, layers, and optional
split definitions.

```yaml
name: DatasetName

# Define an arbitrary number of layers
layers:
  - name: SomeImages          # unique layer name
    type: image               # 'image' for image data and for label data one of: 'semseg' | 'multilabel'
    path: some/path/to/data   # directory
    file_type: .png           # required extension incl. dot (e.g., .png | .nii.gz | .b2nd)
    pattern:                  # optional regex to filter files relative to 'path' without file_type
    backend:                  # optional backend to load/write the data (e.g., sitk | nib) for .nii.gz, etc.
    channels: 3               # number of channels, required for image
    file_stack: False         # True if each channel is a separate file: *_0000, *_0001, ...

  - name: SomeLabels
    type: semseg              # semseg --> Semantic Segmentation | multilabel --> Multilabel Segmentation
    path: some/path/to/data
    file_type: .png|.nii.gz|.b2nd|...
    pattern:
    backend:
    classes: 19               # number of classes, required for semseg/multilabel
    file_stack: False         # for multilabel: true if each class is a separate file: *_0000, *_0001, ...
    ignore_bg: null           # optional bool for labels; if true, class 0 is ignored in metrics and analysis
    ignore_index: 255         # optional int for labels; label value to ignore in loss/eval

# Splitting (optional)
splits:
  splits_file: some/path/splits_final.json # optional: use a file to define splits, content can be:
                              # 1) object: {"train": [...], "val": [...], "test": [...]}
                              # 2) list of folds: [{"train": [...], "val": [...]}, {...}, ...]
  # optional: Per-layer overrides for paths/patterns by split.
  train:
    SomeImages:               # empty -> use defaults
    SomeLabels:               # empty -> use defaults
  val:
    SomeImages:
      pattern: some_pattern   # optional: example override for pattern parameter for layer and split
      path: some/path/to/data # optional: example override for path parameter for layer and split
    SomeLabels:
      pattern: some_pattern
      path: some/path/to/data
  test:                       # empty --> split is not defined
```

</details>

# Config Manager

**TL;DR;**

- Central entry point: validates configs and builds `FileManager`, `Loader`, and `TaskManager` for each dataset layer.
- Config is a YAML file with `layers` (images/labels) and optional `splits`.
- Access layers by name, get file managers for splits/folds, and construct loaders/task managers automatically.

```python
from vidata.config_manager import ConfigManager
from vidata.io import load_yaml

cfg = load_yaml("dataset.yaml")
cm = ConfigManager(cfg)

print(cm.layer_names())  # -> ['SomeImages', 'SomeLabels']
image_layer = cm.layer("SomeImages")

fm = image_layer.file_manager()  # file discovery for this split/fold
loader = image_layer.data_loader()  # ready-to-use loader
arr, meta = loader.load(str(fm[0]))
```

<details>
<summary> Expand for Full Details </summary>

The `config_manager` module ties everything together: it validates dataset
configs, builds the appropriate **FileManager**, **Loader**, and **TaskManager**
for each dataset layer, and applies split definitions (train/val/test or folds).

```py
from vidata.config_manager import ConfigManager
from vidata.io import load_yaml

# Load a dataset config
cfg = load_yaml("dataset.yaml")
cm = ConfigManager(cfg)

# Access layers
print(cm.layer_names())                 # ['SomeImages', 'SomeLabels']
image_layer = cm.layer("SomeImages")

# Get a file manager for train split
fm = image_layer.file_manager(split="train", fold=0)
print(len(fm), "files")

# Build a loader
loader = image_layer.data_loader()
arr, meta = loader.load(str(fm[0]))

# Get the task manager for labels
label_layer = cm.layer("SomeLabels")
tm = label_layer.task_manager()
print("Classes in labels:", tm.class_ids(arr))
```

</details>

# Data Analysis

The `vidata_analyze` CLI computes dataset statistics and writes them to the
specified output directory. Results include:

- **Image statistics**: sizes, resolutions, intensity distributions
- **Label statistics**: class counts, frequencies, co-occurrence
- **Split summaries**: optional per-split analysis

```bash
vidata_analyze -c path/to/datasets/*.yaml  -o <outputdir>
# Analyze a specific split/fold
vidata_analyze -c path/to/datasets/*.yaml  -o <outputdir> -s <split> -f <fold>
```

# Data Inspection

The data_inspections CLI provides an interactive viewer (via Napari) to
browse images, labels, and splits defined in your dataset config

```bash
pip install napari-data-inspection[all]
```

Run the following

```bash
data_inspection -c path/to/datasets/*.yaml
# Inspect a specific split/fold
data_inspection -c path/to/datasets/*.yaml  -s <split> -f <fold>
```
