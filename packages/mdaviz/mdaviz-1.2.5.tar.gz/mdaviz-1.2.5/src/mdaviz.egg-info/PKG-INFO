## Features

* **Data Visualization**: Visualize MDA data with support for 1-D and 2D plots (mesh scans) with matplotlib integration.
* **Auto-Load Folders**: Automatically loads the first valid folder from recent folders list (can be disabled in the preferences).
* **Recent Folders**: Remembers recently opened folders for quick access.
* **Lazy Loading**: Efficient folder scanning with progress indicators for large datasets.
* **Curve Management**: Add, remove, and style multiple data curves.
* **Axis Selection**: Select X-axis (positioners), Y-axis (detectors), I0 normalization, and curve unscaling using checkboxes. Axis selection is saved from one file to the next.
* **Curve Unscaling**: Rescale curves to match the range of other Y curves for better comparison.
* **Data Analysis**: Basic statistics, cursor measurements, and curve fitting.
* **Metadata Search**: Searchable metadata to quickly locate specific parameters and settings.
* **Cross-Platform**: Runs on macOS and Linux (Windows TBD).

## Quickstart

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended for users)

Mdaviz is available on PyPI. We recommend creating a dedicated environment:

```bash
# Create a simple conda environment
conda create -n mdaviz python=3.12
conda activate mdaviz
pip install PyQt6 Qt6

# Install mdaviz
pip install mdaviz
```

Once installed, you can run the application at any time using:
```bash
conda activate mdaviz
mdaviz
```
**Note**:
* PyQt6 and Qt6 are required dependencies that may need to be installed separately via pip as they are not available in conda-forge for all platforms.
* At the APS: PyQt6 requires to install the following library:
```bash
sudo yum install xcb-util-cursor
```


### Option 2: Development setup with conda environment

For development and contributing, it is strongly recommended to use the provided conda environment. This ensures all dependencies (including PyQt6) are available and compatible.

```bash
# Clone the repo first
git clone https://github.com/BCDA-APS/mdaviz.git
cd mdaviz

# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate mdaviz
pip install PyQt6 Qt6

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

Once installed, you can run the application at any time using:
```bash
cd mdaviz
conda activate mdaviz
mdaviz
```

Always activate the environment before running, testing, or using pre-commit hooks.


**Note**:
* PyQt6 and Qt6 are required dependencies that may need to be installed separately via pip as they are not available in conda-forge for all platforms.
* At the APS: PyQt6 requires to install the following library:
```bash
sudo yum install xcb-util-cursor
```


## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Load Data**: Click "Open" (folder icon) and select an MDA file.
2. **Select Axes**: Use the checkboxes in the data table to select:
   - **X**: Positioner for the x-axis (only one can be selected)
   - **Y**: Detectors for the y-axis (multiple can be selected)
   - **I0**: Normalization detector (only one can be selected)
   - **Un**: Unscale curves to match the range of other Y curves (requires Y selection on same row)
3. **Plot Data**: Data will automatically plot based on your selection mode

### Plotting Modes

- **Auto-add**: New curves are added to existing plots
- **Auto-replace**: New curves replace existing plots
- **Auto-off**: Manual plotting using buttons

### Plot Controls

- **Log Scale**: Use the "LogX" and "LogY" checkboxes to switch between linear and logarithmic scales.
- **Curve Styling**: Select different line styles and markers for the selected curve.
- **Data Manipulation**: Apply offset and scaling factors to individual curves.
- **Data Analysis**: Basic statistics, cursor measurements, and curve fitting.



## Development

### Logging and Debugging

**Default Behavior:**
By default, `mdaviz` logs at the WARNING level, showing only warnings, errors and critical messages (quiet mode).

**Command Line Options:**
You can control the logging level using the `--log` argument:

```bash
# Show only errors and critical messages
mdaviz --log error

# Show warnings, errors, critical messages and info (progress messages, file loading status, and important application events).
mdaviz --log info

# Show all messages including debug information
mdaviz --log debug
```
**Log Files:**
Log files are automatically created in `~/.mdaviz/logs/` with timestamps. Old log files (older than 1 day) are automatically cleaned up on startup.


### Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
pytest src/tests
```

Current test status:
- **223 tests passing** with 54% coverage
- **48 skipped tests** (GUI tests in headless environment)
- **0 failed tests** (all tests are now passing!)


### Code Quality

The project uses pre-commit hooks for code quality. Run them before committing:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Contributing

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Make your changes and add tests.
4. Run pre-commit and pytest to ensure all checks pass.
5. Submit a pull request.
