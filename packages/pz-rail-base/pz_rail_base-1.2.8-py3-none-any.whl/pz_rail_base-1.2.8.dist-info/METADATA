# RAIL: Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers

RAIL is a flexible software library providing tools to produce at-scale photometric redshift data products, including uncertainties and summary statistics, and stress-test them under realistically complex systematics.
A detailed description of RAIL's modular structure is available in the [Overview](https://rail-hub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/overview.html) on ReadTheDocs.

RAIL serves as the infrastructure supporting many extragalactic applications of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, including Rubin-wide commissioning activities. 
RAIL was initiated by the Photometric Redshifts (PZ) Working Group (WG) of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) as a result of the lessons learned from the [Data Challenge 1 (DC1) experiment](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/499/2/1587/5905416) to enable the PZ WG Deliverables in [the LSST-DESC Science Roadmap (see Sec. 5.18)](https://lsstdesc.org/assets/pdf/docs/DESC_SRM_latest.pdf), aiming to guide the selection and implementation of redshift estimators in DESC analysis pipelines.
RAIL is developed and maintained by a diverse team comprising DESC Pipeline Scientists (PSs), international in-kind contributors, LSST Interdisciplinary Collaboration for Computing (LINCC) Frameworks software engineers, Sidrat Research, and other volunteers, but all are welcome to join the team regardless of LSST data rights. 


## Installation

Installation instructions are available under
[Installation](https://rail-hub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/installation.html)
on ReadTheDocs.

## Contributing

The greatest strength of RAIL is its extensibility; those interested in
contributing to RAIL should start by consulting the
[Contributing guidelines](https://rail-hub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/contributing.html)
on ReadTheDocs.
