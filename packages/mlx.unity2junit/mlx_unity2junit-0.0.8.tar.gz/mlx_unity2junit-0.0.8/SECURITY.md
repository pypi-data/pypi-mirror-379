# Security Policy

The script is executed on demand and only modifies the files passed to it.
This means that security is completely under the control of users who also have
the option to contain any vulnerabilities, by not executing the script or check the input files for bugs.

## Supported Versions

The latest version will only be supported by security updates since this script
is usually run by demand and with user-controlled data, so the last version is
the only one supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Open an issue on GitHub https://github.com/melexis/unity2junit/issues and
mark it as a security vulnerability. If you can add a reproducible use case
it will very much help with the debugging and quick fixing, but you are
more than welcome to open a Pull Request with a fix (do not forget the detailed
pull request description).
