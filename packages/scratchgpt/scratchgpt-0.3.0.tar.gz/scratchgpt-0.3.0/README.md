# ScratchGPT

![ScratchGPT](./assets/logo.webp)

ScratchGPT is a Python project that implements a small-scale transformer-based
language model from scratch. It provides functionality for training the model
on custom datasets and generating text based on prompts.

## Features

- Custom transformer architecture implementation
- Training on user-provided text data
- Text generation using the trained model
- Flexible tokenization using TikToken
- Command-line interfaces for training and inference

## Roadmap

- [x] Switch to uv
- [x] Make it easy to modify with a config file
- [x] Extract the loss calculation from the model
- [x] Rename main to train
- [x] Create or check tokenizer interface
- [x] Create an easy to use interface
- [ ] Make it into a package
- [ ] Apply SOTA optimizations

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- `uv` for dependency management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/LabStrangeLoop/scratchgpt.git
   cd scratchgpt
   ```

2. Install dependencies using uv:
   ```
   uv sync --all-groups
   ```

## Usage

### Training

To train the model on your custom dataset:

```
uv run train -t <path_to_training_data> -e <experiment_folder>
```

- `-t, --train_source`: Path to the training data file or folder
- `-e, --experiment`: Path to the folder where experiment checkpoints will be saved


### Inference

To generate text using a trained model:

```
uv run infer -e <experiment_folder> [-d <device>] [-m <max_tokens>]
```

- `-e, --experiment`: Path to the folder containing the trained model
- `-d, --device`: Device to run the model on (default: "cuda")
- `-m, --max_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens to generate (default: 512)

### Tokenization

To explore the TikToken tokenizer:

```
uv run tiktoken
```

## Project Structure

- `scratchgpt/train.py`: Main training script
- `scratchgpt/infer.py`: Inference script for text generation
- `scratchgpt/model_io.py`: Utilities for saving and loading models
- `scratchgpt/tokenizer/`: Tokenizer implementations

## Development

This project uses various development tools:

- `mypy` for static type checking
- `ruff` for formatting and standard adherence
- `pytest` for testing

Run the following commands to ensure code quality:

```
uv run ruff --fix .
uv run mypy .
uv run pytest
```
