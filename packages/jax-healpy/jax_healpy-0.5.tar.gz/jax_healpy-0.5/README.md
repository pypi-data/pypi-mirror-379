- **üîÑ Automatic Differentiation**: Full support for forward and reverse-mode automatic differentiation
- **üìä Vectorized Operations**: Efficient batch processing of HEALPix operations
- **üîß HEALPix Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for many healpy functions
- **üåê Spherical Harmonics**: Integration with s2fft for spherical harmonic transforms
- **üéØ Clustering Tools**: Advanced clustering algorithms for astronomical data analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites

First, install JAX following the [official documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for your target architecture (CPU/GPU).

### Install jax-healpy

Install via PyPI:

```bash
pip install jax-healpy
```

For spherical harmonics functionality, install with recommended dependencies:

```bash
pip install jax-healpy[recommended]
```

### Development Installation

Clone the repository and install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pchanial/jax-healpy.git
cd jax-healpy
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax_healpy as hp

# Create a HEALPix map
nside = 64
npix = hp.nside2npix(nside)

# Convert pixel indices to sky coordinates
pixels = jnp.arange(npix)
theta, phi = hp.pix2ang(nside, pixels)

# Convert sky coordinates back to pixels
recovered_pixels = hp.ang2pix(nside, theta, phi, nest=False)

# Spherical harmonics transform (requires s2fft)
alm = hp.map2alm(skymap, lmax=128)
reconstructed_map = hp.alm2map(alm, nside=nside)
```
