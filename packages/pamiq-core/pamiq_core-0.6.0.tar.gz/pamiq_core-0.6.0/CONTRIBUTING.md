        git -v
        ```

#### Developing on Docker container (Recommended)

- üê≥ **Docker (Docker Compose)**

    - Docker Desktop: <https://www.docker.com/get-started/>
    - Docker Engine (Linux only): <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>

    - Verification command:
        ```sh
        uv --version
        ```

## üöÄ Setting Up the Development Environment

### Docker Container Development (Recommended)

1. Repository Setup

    First, fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button:

    [![Fork Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fork%20Repository-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/MLShukai/pamiq-core/fork)

    After fork, clone your repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-name/pamiq-core.git
    cd pamiq-core
    ```

2. Building the Docker Environment

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **USE Git Bash on Windows User**

    ```sh
    # Build the image
    make docker-build

    # Start the container
    make docker-up

    # Connect to the container
    make docker-attach
    ```

3. Git Initial Configuration

    ```sh
    git config user.name <your GitHub username>
    git config user.email <your GitHub email>
    ```

### Local Development

1. Repository Setup

    Same as Docker development - fork and clone the repository.

2. Create Virtual Environment

    ```sh
    make venv
    ```

3. Git Initial Configuration

    Same as Docker development - configure your git identity.

## üíª Development Environment Configuration

### Development with VSCode

You can develop by attaching to the container from your preferred editor (VSCode recommended).

üìö Reference: [Attach with VSCode Dev Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/attach-container)

The development container includes the following environment:

- Package manager ([**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- Git for version control
- Development dependency packages

## üîÑ Development Workflow

Use the following commands for development:

```sh
# Set up Python virtual environment (if not already done)
make venv

# Format code and run pre-commit hooks
make format

# Run tests
make test

# Run type checking
make type

# Run the entire workflow (format, test, type)
make run
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Management

### Stopping the Container

```sh
make docker-down
```

### Cleaning Up the Development Environment

```sh
make clean
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Complete Deletion (Use Caution)

```sh
# Warning: All work data will be deleted!
make docker-down-volume
```

## ü§ù Contribution Flow

1. Create a new branch for feature additions or bug fixes
2. Make your changes
3. Write tests for new features
4. Run the entire workflow before sending a PR:
    ```shell
    make run
    ```
5. Submit a Pull Request with a clear explanation of your changes

If you have questions or issues, please create an Issue in the GitHub repository.
