# Welcome to PAMIQ-Core Documentation!

**pamiq-core** is a minimal machine learning framework for asynchronous execution of inference and training.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity** ‚Äî Clean, intuitive APIs that just work
- **Lightweight** ‚Äî Minimal dependencies, maximum performance
- **Complete Thread Abstraction** ‚Äî Complex threading handled internally, simple interface externally

> When you set out to build a dynamic continuous learning system, PAMIQ Core will be your steadfast foundation.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Parallel Architecture**: Simultaneous inference and training in separate threads
- ‚ö° **Real-time Adaptation**: Continuously update models during interaction
- üßµ **Thread-safe Design**: Robust synchronization mechanisms for parameter sharing and data transfers
- üîå **Modular Components**: Easy-to-extend agent, environment, and model interfaces
- üõ†Ô∏è **Comprehensive Tools**: Built-in state persistence, time control, and monitoring
- üèãÔ∏è **Gymnasium Integration**: Seamless compatibility with Gymnasium environments
- üåç **Cross Platform**: Linux is the primary focus, but Windows and macOS are also supported. (However, some older macOS and Windows systems may have significantly less accurate time control.)

## Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install pamiq-core

# With PyTorch support
pip install pamiq-core[torch]

# With Gymnasium support
pip install pamiq-core[gym]
```

## Basic Example

```python
from pamiq_core import launch, Interaction, LaunchConfig
from your_agent import YourAgent
from your_environment import YourEnvironment

# Create agent-environment interaction
interaction = Interaction(YourAgent(), YourEnvironment())

# Launch the system
launch(
    interaction=interaction,
    models=your_models,
    buffers=your_data_buffers,
    trainers=your_trainers,
    config=LaunchConfig(
        web_api_address=("localhost", 8391),  # Or None to disable web API
        max_uptime=300.0,  # 5 minutes
    ),
)
```

See the [samples on GitHub](https://github.com/MLShukai/pamiq-core/tree/main/samples) for complete examples.

### Remote CLI Control

Once the system is running, you can connect and control it remotely via the terminal using `pamiq-console`:

```bash
# Connect to local system
pamiq-console --host localhost --port 8391

# Connect to remote system
pamiq-console --host 192.168.1.100 --port 8391
```
