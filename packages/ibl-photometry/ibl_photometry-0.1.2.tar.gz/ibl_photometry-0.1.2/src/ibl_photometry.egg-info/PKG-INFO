# photometry-tools
A collection of methods and tools for experimental photometry data

## under construction
this library is right now undergoing some reorganization and is not yet ready for use
stay tuned!
<!-- ## Note about the preferred formats
A good practice is to keep the raw photometry data in a dataframe with columns:
- times
- raw_isosbestic
- raw_calcium
- (optional) calcium


The preferred interchange format is the parquet format (`.pqt`), which is a binary format that is fast to read and write, compressed and keeps typing information.
You can easily convert a dataframe to parquet `pd.to_parquet('my_file.pqt')` and read it back `pd.read_parquet('my_file.pqt')`.

cf. example [here](./src/examples/csv_preprocessing.py) -->
