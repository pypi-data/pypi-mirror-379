# Change Log

## v0.1.0
*initial rust package*
The tool is in a seemingly stable MVP post rust rewrite, featuring the following:
- 20 supported rules and patterns (of varying degrees of quality, need more user testing)
- support for respecting gitignore
- output formats for either azure pipelines or a json format
- configurable model support within openAIs public model ecosystem
- hopefully fewer bugs than before
- an ironically inconsistant overall quality due to me learning rust as i went without supervision (should i use llun on llun?)

## v0.0.1
*initial python package*
This first MVP mockup was quickly put together to test the core concept and features the following features:
- rules support for an arbitrary and unstructured set of common coding idioms
- suport for specified file linting or whole repo linting, but not several specified files linting
- cmd commands
- illegible string formatted json output
- a litany of bugs
