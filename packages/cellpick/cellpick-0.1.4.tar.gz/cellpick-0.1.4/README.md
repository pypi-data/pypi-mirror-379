**CellPick** is an interactive tool designed to streamline the selection of cells for laser microdissection in single-cell spatial omics applications.  
It features a custom shape selection technique that leverages combinatorial optimization to select non-contiguous cells, maximizing coverage within a defined tissue region.  
CellPick also enables users to establish spatial gradients between landmarks, automatically scoring cells by their proximity to points of interestâ€”facilitating downstream analyses such as correlating protein intensities with spatial location.

For a detailed walkthrough, please refer to the [official documentation](https://cellpick.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Installation

We recommend installing CellPick in an isolated environment using pipx.

You can install pipx using ```pip install pipx```. Running ```pipx ensurepath``` will add pipx (and cellpick) to your PATH.

```bash
pipx install cellpick
```

# Launching the GUI

Once installed, simply launch CellPick from your terminal.

```bash
cellpick
```
