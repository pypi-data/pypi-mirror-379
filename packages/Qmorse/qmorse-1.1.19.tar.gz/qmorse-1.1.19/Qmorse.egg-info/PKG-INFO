# Qmorse

**Qmorse** is a lightweight and efficient Python library for **encoding and decoding text into Binary Morse code**. digital communication simulations, cryptography experiments, or just playing with Morse in Python.

Binary Morse code uses `0` for short signals (dots) and `1` for long signals (dashes) and `.` as silence , allowing real word use for Brodcasting use as it mimics how Morse code itself is Used in real life.

Note that this library is made for real use of the morse code.

## Features

- **Encoding and Decoding of the bimorse:** Encode standard text (letters, numbers, and basic punctuation) into a binary Morse representation.
- **File Support:** Read/write binary Morse code to and from `.txt` files and save bimorse as `.bimorse` files.
- **Easy Use:** Simple API designed for both beginners and advanced users.
- **Audio Conversion:** Convert binary Morse sequences into listenable beeps (short/long tones) with customizable timing.

## Installation

Install Qmorse via PyPI:

```bash
pip install Qmorse
```

or via Local install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amiralihabibzadeh/Qmorse.git
cd Qmorse
pip install .
```
## Usage Example
```bash
from Qmorse import bimorse as bim
from Qmorse import soundmorse as sm

text = bim.to_bimorse('Cogito, ergo sum')
bim.save_file(text,'Rene.txt')

sm.bimorse_to_audio(input = text, output = Rene.wav )
```
