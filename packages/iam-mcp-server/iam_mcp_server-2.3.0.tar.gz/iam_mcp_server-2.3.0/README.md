## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Use Claude Desktop as MCP host

The IAM MCP Server is designed to work with Claude Desktop, which provides the necessary MCP host environment. For more details on setting up Claude Desktop with MCP, see the [official MCP quickstart guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

### 2. Add filesystem MCP server

Add the `filesystem` MCP server to Claude Desktop to enable file system access (see Requirements section below for configuration example).

### 3. Get JSearch API token

Create a free account at [JSearch](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch) to get your API token (200 free requests/month).

⚠️ **Note:** This step is optional. You can let the MCP host or another MCP server handle job searches instead.

### 4. Configure IAM MCP Server

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration to run the server directly from PyPI using `uvx`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iam": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from", 
        "iam-mcp-server@latest",
        "mcp-server-iam"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO",
        "RAPIDAPI_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
        "RAPIDAPI_HOST": "jsearch.p.rapidapi.com",
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 📝 Requirements

1. 🗂️ The MCP host must have read and write access to the local file system where it is running. For example, you can run the `IAM MCP Server` within `Claude Desktop`, alongside the `filesystem` MCP Server, which provides this capability. This file access requirement applies to version `1.0` and is necessary for proper operation.

   1.1. Add the `filesystem` MCP server

    ```json
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "filesystem": {
                    "command": "npx",
                    "args": [
                        "-y",
                        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                        "<add directory for filesystem server>"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ```

2. 🔍 The `search job` MCP tool requires access to [JSearch](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/JSearch). You can create an account and get 200 requests per month for free.

## ✨ Features

### Prompts

#### 📊 Analyze Job Market

Directs the LLM step-by-step to perform tasks such as conducting a `job search`, then summarizes and analyzes the resulting job listings. Refer to the full prompt for detailed instructions and context.

#### 📄 Resume Mesh

Easily combine multiple targeted resumes into a single, comprehensive Markdown document.

**What is Resume Mesh?**  
If you’ve applied to similar jobs, you’ve likely created several versions of your resume to match different job descriptions. Resume Mesh brings all those versions together into one unified Markdown file. This gives the MCP host a complete view of your experience and makes it easy to generate new, tailored resumes for future applications.

#### 🎯 Job-Specific Resume Generation

Generate customized resumes for individual job postings.

To use this feature, make sure the MCP host already has access to the `resume mesh`. Each tailored resume is generated using both the resume mesh and the specific job description. You need to attach the `resume mesh` to the MCP host conversation in advance, because the resume generation prompt does not instruct the LLM to load the `resume mesh` from the file system.

#### Cover-Letter Generation

Easily generate a customized cover letter tailored to a specific job description, using the corresponding generated resume.

**How to use:**  
Before generating a cover letter, ensure the MCP host has access to the relevant generated `resume` for the target job. You must manually attach this `resume` to the MCP host conversation, as the cover letter prompt does not automatically retrieve it from the file system.

#### 💾 Save Job

Directs the LLM step-by-step to `save jobs`.

**How to use:**

Start by searching for jobs using the `search jobs` MCP tool. After obtaining the results, you can then instruct the LLM to save those job listings.

### Tools

#### 🚀 Search Jobs

Performs a job search using the following parameters:

- role: The job title or position to search for
- city: (optional) Target city for the job search
- country: (optional) Target country for the job search
- platform: (optional) Specific job platform to use
- number of jobs: (default 5) Number of job listings to retrieve
- slice job description: (optional) Option to include only a portion of the job description

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

The IAM MCP Server can be installed in multiple ways:

### 📦 Desktop Extension (DXT) - Recommended

**One-click installation for MCP hosts!** DXT (Desktop Extension) format provides the easiest way to install and use the IAM MCP Server.

#### Why DXT?

Desktop Extensions eliminate the complexity of manual MCP server setup by bundling everything into a single installable package:

- **No Python installation required** - All dependencies included
- **One-click installation** - Just like browser extensions
- **Automatic updates** - MCP hosts can manage updates
- **Cross-platform** - Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Self-contained** - No environment conflicts

### 🐳 Container Sidecar

Build a self-contained image and run it alongside your MCP host:

```bash
# Build image using published wheel (set APP_VERSION to released tag)
docker build --no-cache --build-arg APP_VERSION=2.1.0 -t iam-mcp-server:2.1.0 .

# For local source builds, omit APP_VERSION or pass APP_VERSION=local
docker build -t iam-mcp-server:dev .

# Start the server with a writable data volume and required secrets
docker run --rm \
  --name iam-mcp-server \
  -e RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=INFO \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
  iam-mcp-server:2.1.0

# OR
docker run --rm -i \
    -e RAPIDAPI_KEY="your-api-key-here" \
    -e LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG \
    -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
    iam-mcp-server:dev

# then initialize the server
'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"0.1.0","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"my-client","version":"1.0.0"}},"id":1}'

# acknowledge the server
'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized","params":{"capabilities":{}}}'

# list available tools
'{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list", "params": {}, "id": 2}'

# list available prompts
'{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "prompts/list", "params": {}, "id": 3}'
```

#### Test the container

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize", "params": {"protocolVersion": "0.1.0", "capabilities": {}, 
  "clientInfo": {"name": "test", "version": "1.0.0"}}, "id": 1}' | docker run --rm -i iam-mcp-server:dev

# List available tools
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list", "params": {}, "id": 2}' | docker run --rm -i iam-mcp-server:dev

# List available prompts
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "prompts/list", "params": {}, "id": 3}' | docker run --rm -i iam-mcp-server:dev
```

Key runtime environment variables:

- `RAPIDAPI_KEY` / `RAPIDAPI_HOST` – credentials for the JSearch integration.
- `IAM_DATA_ROOT` (defaults to `/data`) – location where resume meshes and exports are written.
- `LOG_LEVEL` – structured JSON logs emitted via stdout.
- `MCP_TRANSPORT` – keep `stdio` for sidecar usage or swap for another supported transport when needed.

Attach the container to your MCP host by pointing the host’s configuration at the container entry point. Share the `/data` volume with the host if it needs direct access to generated artifacts.

Look for `iam_mcp_server-[version].dxt` in the release assets.
