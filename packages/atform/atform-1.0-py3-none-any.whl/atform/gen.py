    Should be called once near the end of the script after tests have been
    created with :py:class:`atform.Test`. Calling this function *must*
    be dependent on an ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` condition.
    Furthermore, if the project is organized into multiple scripts, this
    function can only be called from the top-level script.

    .. warning::

        The generated tests will *overwrite* files in the output directory.
        Any content in the output directory that needs to be preserved
        must be copied elsewhere before generating output documents.

    If enabled via the :ref:`command line option <cli_gui>`, the GUI will
    be started automatically by this function, and the specific PDFs generated
    will be determined by user interaction with the GUI. If the GUI is
    launched, this function will not return until the GUI is closed.
