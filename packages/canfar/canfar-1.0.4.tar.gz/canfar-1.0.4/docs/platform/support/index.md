- **[Containers](../containers/index.md)**: Using and building software environments
- **[Interactive Sessions](../sessions/index.md)**: Jupyter, Desktop, CARTA, Firefly
- **[Batch Jobs](../sessions/batch.md)**: Automated and large-scale processing

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Quick Checks

1. Confirm there are no current maintenance announcements
2. Try Chrome or Firefox and clear the browser cache
3. Use a private/incognito window to rule out extensions
4. Verify your network connection is stable

### Frequent Issues

#### Session won't start

- Lower memory or CPU requests and retry
- Try a different container image or launch time
- Ensure your account has the required group memberships

#### Cannot access files

```bash
# Check locations and permissions
ls /arc/home/[user]/
ls /arc/projects/[project]/
ls -la /arc/projects/[project]/
getfacl /arc/projects/[project]/
```

- Confirm the path and project name
- Verify you belong to the correct project group
- Contact the project administrator if permissions are missing

#### Performance feels slow

- Monitor resource usage with `htop`
- Close unused applications and tabs
- Use `/scratch/` for temporary, high-I/O workloads
- Submit a support request if performance remains degraded

#### Browser quirks

- Stick to Chrome or Firefox and keep them updated
- Enable JavaScript and cookies for `canfar.net`
- Disable ad blockers or privacy extensions for the site

### Gather Information Before Asking for Help

Run these commands to capture context for a support request:

```bash
# Platform status
canfar info [session-id]
canfar stats

# Session details
echo $USER
groups
env | grep -E "(CANFAR|SKAHA)"
```
