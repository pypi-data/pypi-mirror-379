# Group management

How to create and manage project groups and permissions via the Science Portal web UI.

Create and manage groups via the CANFAR web UI. Use the edit membership controls to add users and administrators. For complex setups, group permissions can also be managed via command-line tools; see the CANFAR docs for details.

For automated or complex permission changes, prefer the command-line tools described in the CANFAR documentation.
