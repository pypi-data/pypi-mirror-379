# Launching a Desktop session

Steps to start a Desktop session from the Science Portal web UI and connect to it.

To start a Desktop session use the Science Portal web UI. Choose the desired container image and allocate resources (CPU, memory). When the desktop is ready connect using the provided browser window.

After logging in to the Science Portal and clicking the plus sign to
launch a new session, choose a session type of `desktop`.

Note that the remaining menu bars and options update automatically after
your session type selection. There is currently only one option for `container image`, so no selection is needed.

Give your session a descriptive name; this will later appear on your Science Portal page if you need to log in again later

Now, hit the launch button and wait for your session to launch

Congratulations! You've started your first Desktop session. You are automatically returned to the main Science Portal page, where your desktop session appears as an icon, with your chosen descriptive name.

This takes you to the landing page for your Desktop session. Click the connect button to connect to the session.

When your session becomes inactive for some time, you are automatically returned to this page, but you can return to the session exactly where you left off by once again clicking the connect button.
