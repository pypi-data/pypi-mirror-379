# Installation & Set-up

This guide covers everything you need to install and start using CANFAR Science Platform servers worldwide.

!!! tip "New to CANFAR?"
    If you want to jump right in with a hands-on tutorial, check out our [5-Minute Quick Start](quick-start.md) guide first!

## Prerequisites

Before you can use CANFAR, you need:

- **Python 3.10+** installed on your system
- **A Science Platform account** - For CANFAR, [request an account with CADC](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/auth/request.html)

## Installation

Install `canfar` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install canfar --upgrade
```

!!! tip "Virtual Environments"
    We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages:
    ```bash
    python -m venv canfar-env
    source canfar-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: canfar-env\Scripts\activate
    pip install canfar
    ```

## Authentication Set-up

CANFAR uses an authentication context system to manage connections to multiple Science Platform servers. The easiest way to get started is with the CLI log in command.

### Quick Authentication

To authenticate with a Science Platform server:

```bash
canfar auth login
```

This command will:

1. **Discover available servers** worldwide
2. **Guide you through server selection**
3. **Handle the authentication process** (X.509 or OIDC)
4. **Save your credentials** for future use

!!! example "Example Login Flow"
    ```bash
    $ canfar auth login
    Starting Science Platform Login
    Discovery completed in 2.1s (5/18 active)

    Select a server:
    Â» ðŸŸ¢ CANFAR  CADC
      ðŸŸ¢ Canada  SRCnet
      ðŸŸ¢ UK-CAM  SRCnet

    X509 Certificate Authentication
    Username: your-username
    Password: ***********
    âœ“ Login completed successfully!
    ```

### Using CANFAR Programmatically

Once authenticated via CLI, you can use `canfar` in your Python code:

```python
from canfar.session import Session
from canfar.images import Images

# Uses your active authentication context
session = Session()
images = Images()

# List available images
container_images = images.fetch()
print(f"Found {len(container_images)} container images")

# Create a notebook session
session_info = session.create(
    kind="notebook",
    image="images.canfar.net/skaha/astroml:latest",
    name="my-analysis",
    cores=2,
    ram=4
)
print(f"Created session: {session_info.id}")
```

## Private Container Images

To access private container images from registries like CANFAR Harbor, provide registry credentials:

```python
from canfar.models import ContainerRegistry
from canfar.session import Session

# Configure registry access
registry = ContainerRegistry(
    username="your-username",
    password="**************"
)

# Use with session
session = Session(registry=registry)

# Now you can use private images
session_info = session.create(
    kind="notebook",
    image="images.canfar.net/private/my-image:latest",
    cores=1,
    ram=2
)
```

!!! info "Registry Credentials"
    The registry credentials are base64 encoded and passed to the server via the `X-Skaha-Registry-Auth` header.
