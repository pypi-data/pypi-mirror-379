## üîß Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostic Steps

When you encounter issues, try these steps first:

1. **Check system status**: Look for maintenance announcements
2. **Try a different browser**: Chrome and Firefox work best
3. **Clear browser cache**: Remove cookies and cached data
4. **Try incognito mode**: Eliminates browser extension conflicts
5. **Check your network**: Ensure stable internet connection

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Session Won't Start

**Symptoms**: Session creation fails or hangs

**Solutions:**

- Reduce resource requirements (memory/CPU)
- Try during off-peak hours (evenings, weekends)
- Select a different container image
- Check group permissions

#### Can't Access Files

**Symptoms**: Files missing or permission denied

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check file locations
ls /arc/home/[user]/     # Personal storage
ls /arc/projects/[project]           # Group storage

# Check permissions
ls -la /arc/projects/[project]/
getfacl /arc/projects/[project]/
```

- Verify you're in the correct group
- Check file paths are correct
- Contact group administrator

#### Performance Issues

!!! tip "Advanced: Optimising Performance"
    - Use [Batch Jobs](../sessions/batch.md) for large-scale or automated processing.
    - Monitor session resource usage with [`canfar info [session-id]`](../../cli/cli-help.md#canfar-info).
    - Store temporary files in `/scratch/` for faster I/O.
    - For parallel workloads, see [Distributed Computing](../../client/helpers.md).

**Symptoms**: Slow processing or unresponsive interface

**Solutions:**

- Monitor resource usage with `htop`
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use scratch storage (`/scratch/`) for temporary files
- Consider requesting more resources

#### Browser Compatibility

!!! tip "Advanced: Browser Automation"
    - Use browser profiles/extensions for session isolation.
    - Automate repetitive browser tasks with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

**Symptoms**: Interface doesn't load or behaves incorrectly

**Solutions:**

- Use Chrome or Firefox (recommended)
- Enable JavaScript and cookies
- Disable ad blockers for canfar.net
- Update browser to latest version

### Diagnostic Commands

!!! example "Gathering Diagnostic Info for Support"
    Use these commands before contacting support to speed up troubleshooting:

Use these commands to gather information for support requests:

```bash
# System information
