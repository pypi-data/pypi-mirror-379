This unified FAQ covers the CANFAR Science Platform across all areas: Platform, Client, and CLI usage.

## Platform

### What is the CANFAR Science Platform?
The CANFAR Science Platform is a national cloud computing environment tailored for astronomy. It provides interactive notebooks and desktops, browser-native visualization (e.g., CARTA, Firefly), user-contributed web applications, batch jobs, and direct access to CADC data holdings.

### Who can use it and what does it cost?
CANFAR is free for astronomical research. Canadian astronomers and their collaborators can use it subject to fairâ€‘use and allocation limits. For larger needs, request additional resources via the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (DRAC) Resource Allocation Competition.

### How do I get access?
1. To start, you must have a CADC account. If you don't have a CADC account, you can request one at: [https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/auth/request.html](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/auth/request.html)
2. To get CANFAR access, send a short e-mail to support@canfar.net with a short note about who you are, your research and what you plan to do with CANFAR. Include your CADC username. Turnaround is typically 1-2 business days. This can be done in parallel with requesting a CADC account.
3. Alternatively, if you already have a CADC account and you are part of a research group that is already using CANFAR, you can ask your PI to add you to the appropriate project groups.

### What session types are available and when should I use them?
- Notebook: Jupyter Lab for interactive analysis and prototyping.
- Desktop: Full Linux desktop for GUI workflows and multiâ€‘app sessions.
- Firefly: Interactive database access and visualization.
- CARTA: Specialised image/cube visualisation.
- Headless: Nonâ€‘GUI batch processing and automation.

### How long can sessions run?
- Interactive sessions: up to 7 days of continuous runtime, with autoâ€‘shutdown after prolonged inactivity; resumable if not deleted.
- Batch jobs: no strict time limit; queue priority depends on resource usage.

### Can I run GPUâ€‘accelerated workloads?
Yes. Request NVIDIA GPUs in the session configuration from the command line or the API. Ensure your chosen container supports CUDA libraries (i.e. `astroml-cuda`)


### How much storage do I get and where should I put data?

- Personal: `/arc/home/[user]/` (typically 10 GB).
- Project/group: `/arc/projects/[project]/` (hundreds of GB to TBs, varies by project). If you do not have a project space, request one by emailing support@canfar.net.
- Temporary: `/scratch/` inside sessions (cleared when the session ends).

Suggested layout:

- Raw data: `/arc/projects/[project]/raw/`
- Working data: `/arc/projects/[project]/working/`
- Data: `/arc/projects/[project]/data/`
- Results: `/arc/projects/[project]/results/`
- Scripts: `/arc/projects/[project]/scripts/`


### How do I transfer large datasets?

- For files <1 GB, the Science Portal file manager is convenient.

or the VOSpace client `vcp` from the `vos` python package:

- For larger transfers, you can use `sshfs`:

    ```bash
    sshfs -o reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=10,defer_permissions -p 64022 [user]@ws-uv.canfar.net:/ $HOME/arc
    cp largedata.fits $HOME/arc/projects/[project]/data/
    ```

- Or use the VOSpace client `vcp` from the `vos` python package:

    ```bash
    # to vault VOSpace for long-term access
    vcp largefile.fits vos:[project]/data/
    # to arc file system (and VOSpace) for short-term access
    vcp largefile.fits arc:[project]/data/
    ```


### What software/containers are available?

Containers include general astronomy stacks (AstroPy ecosystem), Jupyter, data science tools, machine learning libraries, full Linux desktops, and specialised astronomy tools (CASA, CARTA, DS9, TOPCAT). You can also build and use custom containers. See the Container Guide at `platform/containers/index.md`.


### Can I install additional software?

- `pip install --user ...` (the `--user` option may not be necessary depending on container) or within environments. Software will be persisted on `/arc`
- Permanent: build a custom container with your required stack (see `platform/containers/index.md`). Software will be persisted on the container.


### Collaboration and sharing

- Share data via project groups and `/arc/projects/[project]/` or in vault VOSPace with appropriate permissions.
- Share container images via the Harbor registry on images.canfar.net
- Share code via Git and group storage; document workflows.

### Troubleshooting slow or failing sessions
- **Resource constraints**: Try flexible mode (default) for faster scheduling, or use fixed mode with fewer cores/less RAM if needed. Consider different times of day when cluster load varies.
- **Variable performance in flexible mode**: This is normal - performance adapts to cluster load. For consistent performance, use fixed mode with specific resource values.
- **Container issues**: Verify name/version; try a maintained baseline image.
- **Account/group issues**: Confirm group membership and active account status.
- **Performance optimization**: Process data in fast scratch (e.g., `/scratch/`), parallelize where appropriate, monitor with `htop`, `df -h`, `iotop`.

### Getting help and community
- Documentation: start at `platform/index.md`.
- Help & Support: `platform/support/index.md` (how to contact support and what to include).
- Community: Discord for Q&A and announcements; workshops and office hours are announced there.

## Session Resources

### Why is my session performance variable?
If you're using flexible mode (the default), performance variation is normal and expected. Your session can use more resources when the cluster has capacity available, but may use fewer resources during peak usage times. This adaptive behavior allows for better overall cluster utilization.

For consistent performance, use fixed mode by specifying exact `--cpu` and `--memory` values (CLI) or `cores` and `ram` parameters (Python API).

## Client

### Can I automate session management with the Python client?
Yes. The Python client supports creating, monitoring, and cleaning up sessions programmatically.

Example:
```python
import time
from canfar import Session

session = Session()
sid = session.launch(name="automated", kind="headless", cmd="python", args=["script.py"])

while session.info(sid)[0]["status"] != "Completed":
    time.sleep(60)

session.logs([sid])
session.destroy([sid])
```

### How do I call the REST API directly?
You can use REST endpoints for jobs and sessions if you prefer lowâ€‘level control.

Example:
```python
from canfar.sessions import Session

session = Session()
job_ids = session.create(
    name="automated-analysis",
    image="images.canfar.net/skaha/astroml:latest",
    cores=4,
    ram=16,
    kind="headless",
    cmd="python /arc/projects/[project]/scripts/analyze.py",
)
```

### Authentication options for programs
- X.509 certificates (typical for many users).
- OIDC tokens via SRCNet for advanced and crossâ€‘site workflows. See `cli/authentication-contexts.md` for options and flows.


## CLI


### How do I authenticate?

- Certificates:

    ```bash
    cadc-get-cert -u [user]
    # enter CADC password when prompted
    ```

- OIDC (SRCNetâ€‘aware):

    ```bash
    canfar auth login
    ```

Certificates typically last ~10 days; renew as needed.


### How do I check platform status and quotas from the CLI?

```bash
canfar stats
```


### Why is my session stuck in "Pending"?

Possible reasons: insufficient resources, image issues, quota limits, or maintenance windows. Inspect events:

```bash
canfar events <session-id>
```


### I canâ€™t connect to my session URL

1. Ensure the session is Running (`canfar ps`).
2. Check for VPN/firewall interference.
3. Try another browser or clear cache/private mode.


### Can I run multiple sessions at once?

Yes. You can run multiple sessions concurrently subject to fairâ€‘use and any configured limits per session type. Prefer batch/headless for automation.


### Where can I find more CLI help?

- Quick start: `cli/quick-start.md`
- Auth contexts: `cli/authentication-contexts.md`
- Command reference: `cli/cli-help.md`

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Platform Issues
