!!! success "Collaboration Benefits"
    **Groups enable seamless research collaboration** by providing standardized environments, shared data access, and unified resource management across institutional boundaries.

## üê≥ Container Registry Access (Harbor)

Harbor serves as CANFAR's container registry for storing, managing, and distributing software environments. Understanding Harbor permissions is essential for teams building custom containers or managing specialized software stacks.

### Registry Overview

**Harbor Registry Access:**
:   [https://images.canfar.net](https://images.canfar.net)

**Purpose:**
:   Centralized repository for container images with role-based access control, vulnerability scanning, and automated build integration.

### Harbor Permission Levels

| Role | Repository Access | Image Management | Project Control |
|------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Guest** | Pull public images only | View public metadata | Browse public projects |
| **Developer** | Pull all group images, push to assigned repositories | Upload, tag, and delete own images | View project configurations |
| **Master** | Full repository access within project | Complete image lifecycle management | Project settings, user management |

### Harbor Access Management

**Permission Requests:**
:   Harbor permissions are managed by CANFAR administrators. Contact [support@canfar.net](mailto:support@canfar.net) for:

- **Repository Access**: Request developer or master access to existing projects
- **New Projects**: Set up dedicated projects for your research group
- **Team Management**: Add or modify permissions for team members
- **Repository Configuration**: Set up automated builds and integration workflows

### Working with Harbor

**Authentication:**

```bash
# Login to Harbor registry
docker login images.canfar.net
```

**Pulling Images:**

```bash
# Pull public container images
docker pull images.canfar.net/skaha/astroml:latest

# Pull private group images (requires permissions)
docker pull images.canfar.net/[project]/[container]:[tag]
```

**Pushing Images (Developer/Master roles):**

```bash
# Build and tag your container
docker build -t images.canfar.net/[project]/[container]:[tag] .

# Push to project repository
docker push images.canfar.net/[project]/[container]:[tag]
```

### Project Organization

**Public Projects:**
:   CANFAR-maintained base images available to all users (e.g., `skaha/astroml`)

**Group Projects:**
:   Private repositories for research teams with controlled access and custom software environments

**Personal Projects:**
:   Individual user spaces for development and testing before team integration

!!! tip "Container Strategy"
    **Start with public base images** and extend them for your specific needs. Request team projects for sharing custom environments across your research group.

## üõ°Ô∏è Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Access Control Lists provide fine-grained file and directory permissions beyond traditional POSIX capabilities, enabling flexible collaboration across research teams while maintaining security boundaries.

### ACL Fundamentals

**What ACLs Provide:**
:   Extended POSIX permissions allowing multiple users and groups to have different access levels to the same files and directories.

**Why ACLs Matter for Research:**
:   Enable complex collaborative scenarios where traditional owner/group/other permissions are insufficient for multi-institutional projects.

### Traditional POSIX vs ACL Permissions

=== "POSIX Limitations"
    **Traditional Issues:**
    
    - Only one group can own a file or directory
    - No granular control for multiple collaborating groups
    - Sharing across research teams requires complex workarounds
    - Binary all-or-nothing access for group members

=== "ACL Advantages"
    **Extended Capabilities:**
    
    - Multiple users and groups with different permissions per file
    - Granular read/write access for specific researchers
    - Selective collaboration without compromising security
    - Fine-tuned access for external partners and institutions

### ACL vs POSIX Comparison

| Collaboration Scenario | POSIX Solution | ACL Solution |
|------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Single Team Project** | `rwxrwx---` (group access) | Same as POSIX, no advantage |
| **Multi-Group Collaboration** | Must choose one primary group | Grant specific access to multiple groups |
| **External Researcher Access** | Add to group or make world-readable | Grant individual read access only |
| **Selective Write Permissions** | All group members get write access | Grant write access to specific users only |
| **Cross-Institutional Sharing** | Complex group management | Flexible user and group combinations |

### Viewing ACL Permissions

**Check Current ACLs:**

```bash
# View detailed ACL information for files or directories
getfacl /arc/projects/[project]/[directory]/
```

**Example ACL Output:**

```
# file: sensitive_data/
# owner: alice
# group: myproject-team
user::rwx                    # Owner permissions
user:bob:r--                 # Bob has read-only access
user:carol:rw-               # Carol can read and write  
group::r--                   # Primary group has read-only
group:external-team:r--      # External group has read access
mask::rwx                    # Maximum effective permissions
other::---                   # No access for others
```

!!! warning "ACL Mask Behavior"
    The ACL "mask" entry limits maximum effective permissions for named users and groups. If permissions seem restricted, check the mask value.

### Setting and Managing ACLs

**Grant User Access:**

```bash
# Give user 'bob' read access to a directory
setfacl -m u:bob:r-- /arc/projects/[project]/shared_data/

# Grant user 'alice' read and write access to specific files
setfacl -m u:alice:rw- /arc/projects/[project]/scripts/analysis.py
```

**Grant Group Access:**

```bash
# Allow external group read access to results
setfacl -m g:external-collab:r-- /arc/projects/[project]/public_results/

# Grant write access to multiple collaborating groups
setfacl -m g:partner-institution:rw- /arc/projects/[project]/shared_analysis/
```

**Remove ACL Entries:**

```bash
# Remove specific user access
setfacl -x u:bob /arc/projects/[project]/sensitive_data/

# Remove all ACL entries (revert to POSIX only)
setfacl -b /arc/projects/[project]/temp_data/
```

**Recursive Operations:**

```bash
# Apply ACLs to entire directory trees
setfacl -R -m g:collaborators:r-- /arc/projects/[project]/results/
```

**Recommended Directory Structure:**

```
/arc/projects/[project]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/              # World-readable results
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (ACL: group:world:r--)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team/                # Full team access  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (ACL: group:myproject-team:rw-)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/               # Administrator-only access
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (ACL: user:pi:rw-, group:admins:rw-)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ external/            # Controlled external collaboration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (ACL: user:collaborator:r--, group:external-team:r--)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sensitive/           # Restricted access with specific permissions
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (ACL: user:analyst1:rw-, user:analyst2:r--)
```

**Security Best Practices:**

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum access required for each user or group
- **Regular Audits**: Review ACLs periodically using `getfacl` to ensure appropriate access
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of why specific ACLs were set and who requested them
- **Group Preference**: Use group-based permissions when possible for easier management
- **Inheritance Planning**: Set default ACLs on directories to automatically apply to new files

**ACL Troubleshooting:**

If ACL changes don't take effect as expected:

1. **Check the ACL mask**: `getfacl filename` and verify mask entry
2. **Update mask if needed**: `setfacl -m m::rwx filename`  
3. **Set default ACLs for directories**: `setfacl -d -m g:groupname:rw directory/`
4. **Verify group membership**: Ensure users belong to specified groups

!!! success "Collaboration Success"
    **ACLs enable sophisticated research collaboration** across institutional boundaries while maintaining data security and access control granularity.
