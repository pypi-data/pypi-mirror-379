# Project spaces

Short guide to requesting and sharing a project space for collaborative work.

## What is a Project Space?

Users can work with files in two different main directories. The first is their personal home directory, found in `/home/[username]`. The second is within a project directory, found in `/project/[project_name]`. These project directories provide a space where files can easily be shared and analyzed with collaborators.

## How to Request a Project Space

In order to request a project space, you will need to have a name for the space (the name of the project directory). As with home directories, the default diskspace allocation is 200GB. If you anticipate needing more than this, you will need an estimate of the amount of diskspace that you will need. Once you have this information, if you are on the Discord workspace, the easiest way to request a project space is to post the request there, with a note to Kevin Casteels. Alternatively, you can email the request to `support@canfar.net`.

## How to Give Collaborators Access

Collaborators will require a free CADC account in order to be added as people with designated access to the project space files. A CADC account can be requested at <https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/auth/request.html>. If your collaborators only wish to download the files and analyze them on their own computers, this step is sufficient; they can access the files on the web at <https://www.canfar.net/storage/arc/list/project/[project_name]> or use the VOS Tools to download them.
