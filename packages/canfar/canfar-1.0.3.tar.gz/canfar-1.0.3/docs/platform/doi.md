### Data Publication Service Overview

The **CANFAR Data Publication Service (DPS)** creates permanent links between research papers and their supporting data packages. DPS provides:

- **Permanent Storage**: Reliable hosting for research data packages
- **DOI Registration**: Official Digital Object Identifiers through DataCite
- **Landing Pages**: Professional presentation of datasets and metadata
- **Citation Support**: Proper attribution for data reuse and collaboration

### Access Points

**Web Interface**
:   [CANFAR Science Portal](https://www.canfar.net/) â†’ **Data Publication**

**Direct Service**
:   [Data Publication Service](https://www.canfar.net/citation/)

**Account Requirements**
:   First author requires a CADC account for DPS access and VOSpace data management.

## ðŸ“‹ DOI Workflow Guide

### Step 1: Request a DOI

**Reserve Your DOI:**

- A permanent DOI is assigned to your data package (e.g., [10.11570/20.0006](http://doi.org/10.11570/20.0006))
- A dedicated [Data Directory (VOSpace)](https://www.canfar.net/storage/vault/list/AstroDataCitationDOI/CISTI.CANFAR/20.0006/data) is created
- A professional [landing page](https://www.canfar.net/citation/landing?doi=20.0006) is generated

### Step 2: Upload Data Package

**Choose Upload Method Based on Data Size:**

**Small/Few Files:**
:   Use the Web Storage UI for direct browser upload

**Large/Many Files:**
:   Use [`vos` CLI tools](storage/vospace.md) for efficient bulk transfer

See [Data Package Guidelines](#data-package-requirements) for content organization recommendations.

### Step 3: Referee Access (Optional)

**Peer Review Support:**

CADC can create read-only accounts for editors/referees to access your data directory during the review process. The temporary account is disabled after review completion.

### Step 4: Publish with DataCite

**Final Publication:**

Click **Publish** in the DPS interface to:

- Complete DOI registration with DataCite
- Lock the data directory (preventing further changes)
- Make the landing page publicly accessible

!!! warning "Important: Publication Locks Data"
    After publishing, the data directory becomes read-only. Metadata changes require contacting [CANFAR support](mailto:support@canfar.net).

## ðŸ“¦ Data Package Requirements

### Storage Implementation

**VOSpace Data Directory:**
:   Each DOI receives a dedicated folder in the CANFAR Vault (VOSpace) with a `data/` subdirectory under your control.

**Example Structure:**
:   [Data Directory Example](https://www.canfar.net/storage/vault/list/AstroDataCitationDOI/CISTI.CANFAR/21.0002/data)

### Content Organization

**Recommended Package Contents:**

- **Primary Data**: Core datasets supporting the research
- **Analysis Code**: Scripts and software used in data processing
- **Documentation**: README files describing structure and usage
- **Supplementary Materials**: Figures, tables, additional analysis outputs

**Best Practices:**

- Include a top-level README describing package layout and usage instructions
- Organize files in logical subdirectories (e.g., `raw_data/`, `processed/`, `scripts/`, `figures/`)
- Use descriptive filenames and provide metadata where appropriate

### Upload Methods

**Web Interface Upload:**
:   Web Storage UI for small datasets and simple uploads

**Command-Line Upload:**
:   `vcp` and `vos` CLI tools for large datasets and automated transfers

### Publication & Access Control

**Pre-Publication (Referee Access):**

### Deleting unpublished DOIs

Unpublished records can be deleted via **Delete** on the request page. **Published** DOIs cannot be deleted.

## DOI Data Package

DPS hosts a Data Directory in the **Vault (VOSpace)** implementation for each DOI. A folder named `data/` is created under the DOI root; you control the structure beneath it.

Example: [Data Directory](https://www.canfar.net/storage/vault/list/AstroDataCitationDOI/CISTI.CANFAR/21.0002/data)

!!! warning "Locked after publish"
    After publishing, the directory is **locked**. To modify contents or metadata, contact [CANFAR support](mailto:support@canfar.net).

### Contents

You decide what to include: data, figures, software, etc. We recommend a topâ€‘level `README` describing layout and usage.

### Uploading

- Few/small files: [Web Storage UI](storage/transfers.md#upload-methods).
- Large/many files: [Use `vcp`, `vos` CLI Tools](storage/transfers.md#large-files-100gb-advanced-methods).

### Refereeing access

Contact support to obtain a readâ€‘only account and share with the editor/referee. They may request changes prior to publication.

### Publish & discoverability

After acceptance, click **Publish** to mint the DOI. The directory and metadata freeze; minimal discovery metadata will appear in DataCite search.

### Final linking

Finally, link the **data package DOI** to the **journal DOI** (currently manual):

- Email support with the publication DOI and updated reference details.
- Provide the data package DOI to the journal so it appears in the paper.
