            A biologist is a scientist who conducts research in biology. Biologists are interested in studying life on 
            Earth, whether it is an individual cell, a multicellular organism, or a community of interacting 
            populations. They usually specialize in a particular branch (e.g., molecular biology, zoology, and 
            evolutionary biology) of biology and have a specific research focus (e.g., studying malaria or cancer).
